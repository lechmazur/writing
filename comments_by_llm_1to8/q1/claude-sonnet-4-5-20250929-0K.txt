  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Helena's interiority is concrete and character-specific throughout: preprocessing through spreadsheets and decade catalogs, then transferring that methodology to the butterfly scales. The final choice to begin again with caterpillars in spring carries visible cost—accepting impermanence and her own pattern-making limits. Internal contradiction operates clearly: she chose butterflies to escape analysis, yet the flood strips that pretense and she returns to what she knows, now with "kindled humility." Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "preprocessed reality" framing, but the trait shapes on-page choices consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear—survival and truth-seeking—and her glass-artist expertise shapes her perception (frost as "nature's glass"). However, the final choice feels undercooked: Galloway's surrender happens off-page, robbing the confrontation of earned cost. The "steadily adaptive" trait is told more than shown in micro-choices under pressure, and the interior monologue about glass and patience reads as thematic packaging rather than embodied thought during a gunpoint standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior transformation is traced through embodied thermal patterns rather than articulated thought, showing contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) acting simultaneously. The mid-story shift from passive survivor to active collaborator demonstrates agency, though the final choice feels more like acceptance than a decision with visible cost. Professor Chen remains a facilitator without his own pressure or arc. The emotional progression from "jagged reds of early trauma" to "softer hues" reads somewhat mechanically—closer to summary than lived contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcel's motivation is clear and his professional identity anchors his choices, but his interior life remains largely functional rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The dreams provide exposition more than dramatized internal conflict; his decision to close the parlor and descend feels compelled by plot mechanics rather than wrestling with competing values. The ghosts are handled competently but remain a collective presence without individual pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse—"strange stillness that had settled in his bones" gestures at interiority but doesn't show contradictory feelings acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's choice to declare herself after months of anonymous work is motivated by a clear concern about cultural continuity, and the young woman's response provides embodied confirmation. However, the resolution feels too clean—families arrive, listen, and the young woman's pledge arrives without visible internal struggle or cost to her own plans. The dawn-to-morning compression and Mara's interior access remain consistent, but the emotional pivot at the arbor lacks the contradictory impulses that would mark genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mei's interior is lushly rendered but rarely contradictory; her quest unfolds as contemplative observation rather than压迫ed choice. The pilgrim remains a catalyst without internal friction. The final act—leaving the jade tear—reads as graceful release rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Therapy-speak intrudes: "unresolved attachment" and "the vast reservoir of unuttered devotion" flatten what could be embodied grief.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's retrocognitive condition shapes her perception and drives her maze-building compulsion, but her agency feels primarily observational rather than conflicted. The final "placement" of the fragment back into the railing reads as acceptance without visible cost—she's already lost her photographs, but the emotional price of that loss isn't dramatized in the moment. Interior voice leans heavily on abstract philosophical language ("texture of time," "recursive existence") that distances the reader from embodied emotional stakes. The transformation from designer to "both designer and designed" asserts understanding without showing a genuine foreclosure or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's planning and strategic patience are consistently shown through micro-choices (decoding keys, arranging them by piano octaves, working calmly under time pressure). Her motivation to preserve seed diversity drives concrete actions from escape to final planting. However, the character feels more like a vehicle for thematic delivery than a person with contradictory impulses; her competence is never genuinely threatened, and the escape unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or cost that might foreclose alternate paths.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is concrete and rooted in a specific loss—her daughter's silence. Her internal contradictions manifest through embodied action: collecting absences, building the forge, ultimately choosing to destroy rather than preserve the crystalline matrix. The final choice forecloses a path with felt cost ("memory became something else entirely—not forgotten, but finally released"). Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated closing reflection ("Both were true. Both had weight"), which edges toward diagnostic clarity rather than living through the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's arc from thief to artist is present but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The moonbeam revelation ("I'm not the thief. I'm the subject") arrives via exposition rather than dramatized choice with visible cost. Celeste functions primarily as an oracle dispensing insight rather than applying pressure that forces Maya to struggle. The final walk-away feels contemplative rather than earned through on-page friction between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus's interiority is vivid and character-particular, with contradictory impulses operating simultaneously—his habit of narrating to emptiness reveals both isolation and pedagogical hope. The motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" is established early and drives his final decision to visit his sister. His choice to pocket the bookmark and plan tomorrow's gesture is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (forfeiting years of protective distance). Minor deduction: the thawing-heart metaphor skirts diagnostic territory but remains dramatized through glasswork and spatial choices.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her claustrophobia/stunt double background provides embodied history, but internal contradiction rarely acts simultaneously in scene—phobias are invoked as backstory more than live obstacles. The final call to authorities shows agency, yet the epiphany "vulnerability wasn't weakness" arrives as a thesis statement rather than emerging from a specific on-page choice that forecloses a path. Reeves as secondary character applies pressure effectively, but Emma remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's "obsession with endings" is told rather than embodied in contradictory choices under pressure. Her actions (arriving, reading silences, drawing the map) follow a smooth professional arc without internal friction or cost. The commander remains a receptacle for her wisdom rather than a character with competing motives. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    J-7's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with the question about thought-origins driving consistent behavior across loops. The violin-playing sequence effectively embodies his emerging consciousness through action rather than label. Dr. Yemeni functions primarily as exposition delivery, lacking sufficient pressure or status dynamics. The final realization feels earned by the iterative structure, though the shift from "I cannot locate it" to understanding occurs slightly too smoothly without visible internal contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is specific and concrete—the lens work, the collected doodles—but the emotional progression feels rushed at the closure. The move from "I don't know how to tell her" (Dmitri's fear) to Mira's decisive action lacks contradiction under pressure; she processes the overheard confession and acts without visible internal conflict. The final exchange "I think we're done hiding behind unclear meanings" reads as a stated realization rather than an embodied one with cost. Minor label-speak ("burden of unwanted knowledge," "resonant hush of shared understanding") reduces immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine dresser's motivation is concrete and embodied through her ritual with the marbles, each polishing commemorating a transformation from deception to mastery. Her interiority shows through physical action rather than exposition, with contradictory impulses visible in her steady voice while her hands "polished faster." Marcus functions cleanly as witness-participant; his arc from seeking validation in measurements to recognizing unmeasurable truth is earned through observation and the garden's response. Minor slip: the vine dresser's backstory arrives in exposition rather than fragmented discovery, though it tilts her present stance effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to prove the temporal anomaly is consistent and drives their actions, with the vindication moment at the end feeling earned. However, the internal contradiction and embodied struggle remain thin—Kael moves smoothly from mechanic to discoverer without visible cost or friction. Venn's presence adds pressure but her shift from skepticism to awe happens too quickly without dramatized resistance. The ending choice (returning to calibrations) reads more as thematic gesture than a decision that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marta's motivation to decode the ghost's message is clear and sustained, with embodied choices (playing specific notes, wading to the stage, photographing evidence). Her interiority shows purposeful action under pressure—"she'd been piecing it together"—and the final promise ("I heard you") carries earned weight. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she never doubts her interpretation or fears consequences, which flattens the psychological texture. The ghost remains abstract, a communication partner rather than a force that complicates Marta's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's progression from fever-broken clarity through diagnosis to redesign is consistently motivated by her grief over Reeves and her professional guilt. Her interior reflection about fault-tolerance and nightshade illustration reads as character-particular and anchors her final choice in prior causality. Chen functions primarily as sounding board but his grief is noted and his collaboration at closure is credible. Minor deduction: the peak emotional beat ("auroral sorrow") borders on over-articulation; the phrase reads slightly imposed rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus exhibits consistent goal pursuit through the tunnel exploration and call interpretation, with embodied alertness ("drowsy alertness that came from three consecutive nights"). His interior reasoning feels character-specific when decoding patterns, but the move from observation to the final understanding feels more narrated than dramatically earned—he "understood" rather than arriving through a micro-choice under pressure. The final climb back lacks visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply documents and leaves, which undercuts the sense of transformation or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation shifts from preservation to witnessing, but this transformation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Interior life relies heavily on abstract philosophical summary ("She no longer sought to judge which knowledge deserved saving") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The origami swan discovery and subsequent burrowing lack micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost; the protagonist flows through decisions without genuine struggle or competing wants. The final smile in darkness feels too settled, lacking the flawed resistance that would make the acceptance costly.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority shows consistent motivation through the keepsake and her therapeutic approach, but the characterization leans heavily on professional competence without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Thomas's selective mutism breakthrough feels somewhat schematic—the humming-to-words progression is clean but lacks the messy psychological resistance that would make the shift costlier. The mother's reaction is summarized rather than dramatized, missing an opportunity to show Mara processing success with her characteristic doubt. Embodied emotion is present ("tears threatening but held back") but stays controlled throughout, never degrading under the pressure of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miren's motivation is clear and her sensitivity to objects is embodied through concrete handling of the tapestry and diaries. However, she remains observational throughout—no internal contradiction or high-stakes choice forces her to weigh competing values. The connection to Catherine reads as discovery rather than dilemma, and the ending smile suggests satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path. The work stays in chronicler mode without pressure that would test her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's legacy, but her competence feels frictionless—she orchestrates the entire operation without meaningful struggle or error. The backstory fragment about her father discovering journals and wanting to "transpose life into a new key" provides thematic grounding, but Maya's own interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory under pressure. The micro-choices (which fortune to write, which restaurant receives Wednesday's batch) feel logistical rather than values-testing, and no visible cost constrains her during execution.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    Father Calloway's motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Marcus exists primarily as an object of rescue with no interior conflict shown; we never see him grapple with the entity's promises versus his own fear. The priest's actions align with his role but lack genuine struggle or visible cost—he walks away whole, preparing his next homily, suggesting competence without complication. Interiority relies heavily on abstract theological language ("unraveled stillness," "muffled clarity") rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is vivid and embodied through the nautilus shell handling and morning ritual, though her epiphany about "translating" rather than "predicting" arrives with light preparation—the shift feels more declared than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The chronological homesickness remains largely a therapist's label rather than constraining specific choices with visible cost. Grandfather's presence is rich but operates as backstory scaffold; the final descent with "ready to write fortunes that sang" tells the transformation rather than dramatizing a renunciation or concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority shows contradictory impulses—running versus confronting—and the final choice to retrace "the harder path" feels earned by prior causality. Embodiment is present ("felt gravity loosen," "ache in her knees") but some therapy-speak intrudes: "labyrinth of self" and "procedurally generated realities" read diagnostic rather than lived. The moment where she "pressed her thumb against the deepest rune" and fragments rejoin carries visible cost (gravity reasserts, singularity returns), though the gathering of selves could be more concretely dramatized. Minor penalty for label-speak in peak beats ("cowardice," "infinite maybes") that slightly abstracts the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Oskar's motivation is clear and his deafness constrains his approach in meaningful ways. The shift from numbness to "quiet certainty" has causal groundwork through Marie's progress and the discovery method. However, the internal experience relies heavily on abstract labels ("emotional numbness," "quiet certainty") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. Marie's arc is functional but her interior life remains thin—she arrives determined, reports feeling, and departs accepted—without the contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marianne's choices are driven by consistent, character-specific motives—her meticulous nature and isolation-nurtured integrity. The interiority is concrete ("her pulse quickened, though her expression remained calm") and the trait of curiosity constrains her actions with visible cost (she accepts the satchel despite risks). Minor slip: the woman's rapid trust feels slightly convenient, but the final choice to map coordinates in solitude is fully earned by prior pattern-recognition obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marcus's interior is concrete and specific in places—"reverence he'd once reserved for particularly elegant metaphors," tracing rope wear "like braille"—but his stakes remain abstract contemplation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The protagonist observes transformation but never faces a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; Sarah's appearance and fade feel like confirmation rather than complication. The renunciation or stance crystallization required for Earned Stasis is absent; Marcus ends where he began, bearing witness without agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's acoustic perception is embodied through concrete action—hearing harmonics in glass panels and shipwreck hulls—and her choice to perform unfinished pieces shows internal consistency. Her motivation to honor her great-aunt while addressing the chronic hush is clear and specific. The family members remain lightly sketched but functionally present; the piece stays tightly focused on Maya's interior experience and her micro-choices during the performance. Minor issue: the mendicant's bowl transition (upside-down to water-filled) feels slightly unmotivated but does not break character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal contradiction between professional expertise and emerging moral doubt is embodied through concrete sensory actions (static electricity, blotter manipulation). The shift from counterfeiting easy lies to creating "something more honest" is earned through accumulative pressure rather than epiphany. Minor slip: "affectionate detachment" appears twice as a label without sufficient behavioral grounding in the middle section. The final choice feels motivated by the amber's metaphoric pressure rather than pure character agency, but the renunciation is legible and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marianne's shrewdness is asserted through her professional reputation but never tested on the page—she makes no difficult choices between competing goods. The friendship with Chen unfolds without friction or contradictory impulses; both women move in harmony toward a shared goal with no visible internal conflict. Chen's daughter backstory anchors emotion, but Marianne's arc from broker to documentarian happens off-page across "following weeks," summarized rather than dramatized. The lighthouse keeper's near-tears reads as convenient validation rather than earned resistance overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's journey from isolation to integration is clearly motivated, and her choice to create the sculpture emerges from established traits. The final moment "finally understanding that belonging wasn't about disappearing into the webs of kinship, but about adding your own thread" reads as diagnostic label-speak that flattens what the sculpture already dramatized. Internal contradiction is present (wanting connection but unable to cross into the arbor) but the resolution feels slightly over-explained rather than purely embodied. Minor embodiment issue: "tears streaming down her face" is functional but borders on cliché in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interiority shows embodied emotion—"satchel heavy," pendant "warm against her chest"—and her motivations drive specific choices: borrowing time, releasing it to free the echo. Internal contradiction surfaces when she must uncage what she worked to trap, a genuine micro-tension. The backstory about her mentor is economical and anchors the present search, but the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally urgent, keeping emotional range in mid-high rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is richly imagined—her grief-driven descent into the cavern, the conjuring practice rooted in mathematical thinking—but her choices lack genuine conflict. She kneels, positions glass eyes, whispers calculations, and observes a vision without any competing impulses or cost visible on the page. The ending acceptance ("some systems remained unsolvable while still being true") arrives as philosophical summary rather than earned through a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path. The brother's absence is felt, but Elara's endurance reads more as aesthetic melancholy than visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interiority is specific and embodied through the smell-memory trigger and her patient methodology. However, her motivation to "matter" and achieve "visibility" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final satisfaction feels too complete—no visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies her transformation into "keeper of sense memories." The character arc lands as wish fulfillment rather than earned stasis with sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and her shift from control to surrender is traced through specific micro-choices (leaving weeds, stopping scheduled pruning, keeping the moss). The metamorphosis is embodied through her evolving relationship with the plants, and her grandmother's voice provides productive friction. However, the final act—letting the leaf go—feels more symbolic gesture than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path; the piece tells us she's changed more than it dramatizes a painful trade-off in the closing beat. The blend of research identity and folk wisdom is character-particular, but the epiphany ("finally understood") leans toward summary at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The painter's interiority shows some embodied pressure—insomnia as vigil, the tingling recognition—but the internal contradiction remains largely told ("meaning had become slippery") rather than dramatized through incompatible impulses acting simultaneously. Marcus functions primarily as exposition vehicle; his dialogue delivers world-building but rarely applies immediate pressure that forces the painter into a choice with cost. The final "ready to sleep" shift is stated rather than earned through a foregrounded micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and distinctive—copper-and-starlight synesthesia, the bright darkness behind her eyelids—and her arc from oracle to wonderer is earned through on-page confrontation. The transformation choice at the end ("Teach me") feels motivated by the accumulated cost of prophecies that "diminished everything." Minor slip: the pilgrim-as-emissary feels more like a catalyst device than a fully embodied character, though his function as unseen-force representative is clear. Internal contradiction (knowing vs. mystery) drives her final renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's reactive vision is embodied through concrete micro-choices (the valve, the staggered viewing intervals, walking away from reunions toward the archive). Interior contradiction surfaces in her simultaneous hope and guardedness, her need to measure emotional exposure in ten-second doses. The final walk with Thomas earns a shift from solitary archivist to bridge-builder, and the cost—seventeen years of lonely attention—is visible. Thomas remains somewhat thin, but his trembling acceptance of the valve and request to see the archive apply enough pressure to test Marina's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's analytical-artistic duality is established early and shapes her approach to mapping the fortress. Her choice to "dare" is motivated by seven years of charting routes and sensing hidden patterns, though the internal contradiction between rationality and mystery-seeking could be more viscerally embodied. The moment she finds her own name in the fortress reads as convenient self-discovery rather than earned revelation through prior on-page struggle. Her final mapmaking action aligns with established traits but the cost of validation feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's shift from skeptic to believer is motivated by the mystical experience but lacks embodied contradiction in the moment—she moves smoothly through vertigo to acceptance without genuine internal friction. The "courageously kind" trait is explained retrospectively rather than dramatized through a present choice with visible cost. Interiority leans toward expository summary ("the deeper truth she'd inherited understood") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to transcribe feels inevitable but somewhat thesis-stated rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cassius's interiority is concrete and dimensionally specific; his three-thousand-year boredom drives the opening pursuit clearly. Naia's motives land with embodied cost—her "suffocating" half-life and tears refracting into prisms ground her final choice. The relationship crucible forces Cassius into recognition ("finally understood what he'd lost"), and his pivot to tearing dimensions apart again shows earned character momentum. Minor slip: Naia's shift from accusation to confession feels slightly compressed; one more micro-choice in her approach would tighten causality.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and action-driven—her mathematical metaphor for honesty shapes her choices consistently. The father's reaction to exposure is embodied ("pale as the corpse") and his tears earn their place. The relationship pressure is clean: confrontation forces stance crystallization with visible cost (his freedom traded for rehabilitation). Minor slip: Vincent's "you're breaking the family tradition" risks stock phrasing, though it's brief and tied to his con-artist worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stationer's motivation to "collect the textures of different times" is consistently embodied through her notepad practice and sensory attention to lamp hums and disproportionate blooms. Her final choice to "record it falsely" at the honest oak demonstrates internal contradiction with visible cost—renouncing truth-telling even when unnecessary. However, the interiority leans abstract ("earnestly studious," "incandescent restraint") rather than immediate and particular under pressure; key moments like pressing the maple roots feel more poetic than viscerally embodied. The turn at the center oak is credible but the path there accumulates texture more than it dramatizes escalating internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's internal state is established through action and observation rather than exposition, with her shift from fighting bureaucracy to collecting fragments showing character through choice. The harbormaster encounter provides embodied emotion ("studied her face with recognition"), and her final decision to "fix the paperwork" while knowing she'll return demonstrates contradictory impulses. However, the transformation feels略 too smooth—her move from ghost to archivist to resolution lacks the messy friction of genuine internal conflict. The notebook handoff and her epiphany about "becoming temporarily nameless" edge toward thesis statement rather than earned realization through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's professional identity as myth-buster is clear and her motivation to prove her grandmother wrong anchors the opening. The shift toward understanding "the space between things" feels thematically driven rather than earned through concrete struggle—she arrives at insight through reflection rather than pressure-tested choices. The grandmother's voice emerging through the shell/cello is told as an effect rather than dramatized as a choice-altering experience. Interiority leans toward summary and therapeutic language ("gloomy cheerfulness," "everything that had been said and everything that never would be") in place of embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interior is established through her role and gift for reading disorientation, but her dual allegiance remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The foundation stone chip provides a concrete anchor for her past, yet her decision to reorganize through graffiti feels more like a summary of offstage action than a choice unfolding under pressure. The final encounter with the newcomer shows her teaching intention, but the cost of her resistance—what she's foreclosing—reads as conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Chen's motivations are clear and his interiority is concrete ("fighting the dawnlit melancholy," the trembling hands), but his emotional progression feels too smooth—no genuine friction between his scientific detachment and personal investment. The nightwatch grain revelation reads as epiphany-by-magnifier rather than earned internal contradiction. The character executes tasks methodically but lacks the blind spots or costly mistakes that would make his choices feel genuinely difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her blindness shapes her perception consistently through water, sound, and temperature. Her motivation to make broken things whole is clear and embodied through action. However, the core repair feels too competent—the fractured lens is diagnosed and patched without genuine struggle or complication, and the emotional stakes ("every repair was personal") are asserted more than tested by on-page friction. The relationship with Voss remains functional but one-directional; he supplies tension through his deadline but doesn't apply real pressure that forces Mara into a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her editor's eye for pattern is character-specific, but her certainty ("as if she already knew what she'd find") undercuts genuine struggle. The final choice to drill is presented as predetermined rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Petrov functions as a sounding board without applying meaningful pressure. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves from observation to departure without friction or stakes that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    The bell tuner remains a cipher throughout—her motivations are asserted ("infinite patience," "understanding of how broken things harmonize") rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. The town's residents are sketched in brief gestures (baker, schoolteacher, old Matthias) but never press back or complicate her work; their joining her rhythm feels automatic rather than earned through struggle. No meaningful internal contradiction appears, and the protagonist's arc is a straight line from arrival to success without visible cost or trade-off. The label "infinite patience" is invoked but never tested by an on-page obstacle that forces her to choose between speed and thoroughness.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's conflict between desire for the vial and duty to Chen is embodied through "fingers lingered on the crystal" and her concrete choice to pocket it. Chen's oxygen-deprivation progression tracks cleanly and his three-day obsession dramatizes the trap rather than merely declaring it. Interior states are grounded in physical details (weathered face, trembling palm, color returning). Minor flaw: Chen's leap from "I can't leave it" to passive compliance happens quickly, though shock and hypoxia provide partial motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Matthias's interior remains largely abstract—"felt himself begin to hover" and his choice to stay are told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The father exists only in backstory; the three prisoners deliver exposition but never pressure Matthias with conflicting wants. The final choice feels unearned because no on-page cost or foreclosed path is dramatized; he simply steps into the light without struggle or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his micro-choices (kneeling, burying the bead, speaking forgiveness) track consistently under pressure. Eleanora's lovingly venomous ambition is shown through her backstory confession but her present agency is limited to narration and instruction rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice feels earned by the bloodline premise but the protagonist's internal contradiction is minimal—he accepts his role without visible hesitation or cost to a competing want. Embodied emotion is present ("the bead burning hot") but interiority leans toward receptive understanding rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The weaver's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interior life remains thin—she operates more as a symbolic figure than a person with contradictory impulses. The sleepwalking device cleverly externalizes agency, yet we never see her wrestle with doubt or cost in real time; the work proceeds with dreamy inevitability. The ending renunciation ("her fingers already missing the red dust") gestures at emotional weight but arrives as assertion rather than earned consequence. Embodied struggle and visible tradeoffs are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interior life is legible—her hollow faith, her recognition of completion in her grandmother's work—but the protagonist spends most of the text in observational wandering without contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The decision to stay at the end feels declared rather than earned through visible cost or a foreclosed alternative on the page. Emotional states lean toward summary and label ("hollow weight," "tentative, more honest") rather than embodied perception. The passivity and lack of on-page friction cap the score.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iris's interior contradiction is well embodied: she creates false identities yet yearns to reclaim her true name, and this tension drives her hesitation at the mail slot. The kneeling, trembling fingers, and hand hovering over brass are concrete and character-particular. The backstory about her daughter and fifteen-year disappearance is extensive (~25% of text) but anchored to present stimuli (the letter, the arcade, the chalk codes) and tilts her final choice. Minor slip: "wondering who she would be when the reply finally came" edges toward diagnostic self-awareness but doesn't fully break embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mirelle's core motivation (listening to unheard stories) is well-established and her eccentric-embroiderer disguise creates consistent tactical choices. However, her competence feels unearned—three months of passive listening yields complete intelligence without visible struggle or error. The final prayer "Let someone understand" lands with appropriate vulnerability, but the journey there lacks the contradictory impulses or meaningful miscalculation that would elevate character work into the 8+ range. Internal conflict is more declared than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Meera's compassion and practiced tenderness come through in her handling of the client, and the woman's grief is embodied through trembling hands and tears. The client's shift from "trapped" to "no longer trapped" registers as emotional change, though the arc is somewhat light for the length. Meera herself remains a facilitator without meaningful internal conflict or choice under pressure; her role is consistent but static, which limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maricel's consciousness under anesthesia provides clear POV filter and embodied experience. Interior voice is distinct and reflective without therapy-speak; the translator's professional habit of witnessing meaning before dissolution shapes her perceptual signature. The decision to investigate after waking is earned by prior causality—three weeks carrying the coral, the child's encrypted message, her understanding of truth's danger—and forecloses the passive path with visible professional and personal risk. Micro-choices (fighting the anesthetic, gripping the coral) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interior contradiction—stubborn commitment to beauty in fog versus recent creative hollowness—drives her choices credibly. The fragment triggers a daydream that shifts her approach from "forced cheer" to organic luminescence, and the final choice to paint the district itself reflects earned insight. Embodied emotion is present ("laughed, surprising herself") but the epiphany moment ("joy wasn't the subject; it was the method") reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis awareness. The renunciation of performative joy and acceptance of mist-bound beauty forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's interiority is concrete and consistently filtered through her restorer's lens ("methodically playful," mixing pigments as conversation). Her choice to tap the wall and then clean rather than report the discovery shows agency with visible cost (professional risk). Internal contradiction appears when she acknowledges she should report but chooses curiosity over certainty, embodied through tactile engagement with the work. Minor slip: the dream sequence functions more as atmospheric backstory than immediate pressure on present choice, though it primes the nested-awakening theme.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is given "charming rogue scholar" traits but these function as labels rather than embodied contradictions that complicate his choices. His "candidly cryptic" speech and roguish smile are asserted, yet his internal conflict never surfaces—he moves through the scene with perfect certainty. Mara and the seventeen club members remain functional extras; no relationship pressure forces a trade-off. The final "begin" moment lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path, reading more as a rallying beat than a choice with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interior life is vividly rendered through her insomnia and transformation metaphor, with embodied choices like keeping the postcard and reading her work aloud. However, the character operates in near-total isolation for 300 years without meaningful internal contradiction or on-page friction between competing impulses. The final beat repeats her established stance rather than testing it with cost; she "began again" without forfeiting a live option or crystallizing a changed hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miren's interior world is richly textured through her preservation work and relationship to her mother's memory, but her choices remain largely observational until the final decision not to repair the chime. The choice to document rather than restore demonstrates internal values, though the stakes of this decision feel muted—no competing pressure tests her commitment. Embodied emotion appears in "foxglove regret bloomed in her chest," but much of the piece operates in contemplative mode without visceral contradiction or crisis-level stakes that force harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivations are clear and rooted in her professional expertise and personal guilt. Her internal conflict between safety and honesty drives the key choice to write the Varesh confession, though the emotional embodiment leans abstract ("chest ache") rather than viscerally particular. Marcus remains thinly sketched—his withdrawal and the final handclasp feel more functional than lived. The pivotal confession moment shows contradictory impulses ("carefully reckless abandon") but the cost of exposure never tests Mira's fear in scene; she writes, he reads, reconciliation follows without visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to harmonize values is clearly established, and her micro-choices (measuring, sketching modifications, leaving the envelope unsealed) reveal character under pressure. However, interiority often tilts toward thesis-statement thinking rather than embodied contradiction—"encrypted compassion, Mira thought—desperation disguised as technical inquiry" reads as label-speak rather than lived tension. The grandfather's aphorism and the final reflections on "encrypted compassion finally decoded into action" feel like thematic placeholders rather than earned realizations from scene pressure. Agency is present but the emotional progression smooths toward wisdom rather than wrestling with genuine ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's interiority is concrete and particular—her impulse to flee and difficulty with trust emerge through embodied choices rather than summary. The pigeon-training backstory anchors her perceptual signature (mapping air currents, reading invisible rivers), and her micro-choices (placing the meteorite as anchor, continuing cataloging despite flight impulse) reveal hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction between the instinct to flee and the decision to stay is dramatized in scene. Minor slip: the final paragraph's "learning to become" edges toward summary rather than showing the cost of staying.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is textured and character-specific—her methodical reading of grain patterns feels earned from her father's architecture. However, the core motivation remains somewhat abstract; her "featherly determined" approach is labeled rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The ending choice to "build thresholds" feels asserted rather than dramatized through a visible fork with cost. Thomas functions primarily as a sounding board without applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Senna's interior life is vivid and her motivation (seeking belonging) is embodied through her choices to study the city and ultimately suit up. The predecessor's burnt feather and abrupt note-ending create intrigue but feel slightly convenient as setup. Mara is functional but lightly sketched; their bond is asserted more than dramatized. The final decision to "enter" the phenomenon carries weight but the cost remains implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's interior life is present through her specialized skill and quest, but her choices lack contradictory impulses. The discovery that unmade paths are "deliberately removed" arrives as exposition rather than earned struggle—she observes and concludes without visible cost or internal conflict during the revelation. Her "cheerful gloom" is labeled rather than embodied in contradictory action. The final departure carries no dramatized trade-off between staying to explore further and leaving before the tide.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is specific and embodied through her chess performance and orchestration of street performers. Internal contradiction appears in her surprise at being outmaneuvered despite her control obsession, and the bishop touch anchors her father's influence without label-speak. The woman's characterization through chess moves ("aggressive queen deployment, overprotective of pawns") demonstrates reading via action, though Rebecca's sudden job offer feels slightly convenient. The ending choice to hear more is earned by the demonstrated gap between Mara's control and her need for genuine surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaleth's motivation ("pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin") is declared in paragraph three but never tested by a competing desire or obstacle that forces a trade-off. Her internal state remains a single unbroken note—reverent determination—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The grandmother memory and exile backstory anchor her stance but do not create friction in the present. The caretaker's discovery at dawn names the result without showing how Kaleth's choice forecloses a path or accepts a cost she resists on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Martin's interior state is sustained through specific embodied perception (hands scarred from cuts, eyes trained to see fractures) and his realization about value emerges from concrete sensory engagement with the pond. The protagonist's motivations remain consistent—seeking unnamed fulfillment, finding it through attention—but the epiphany arrives without sufficient internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shift from "hollow" work to illuminated purpose reads as a smooth cognitive glide rather than a wrestled choice with visible cost. Minor: the voice occasionally drifts toward lyric generalizations ("colors that had no names, only the feeling of revelation") that soften character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's scarred identity and obsessive firefighting read as consistent traits, and his choice to return the box to his daughter is motivated by the ridge-path reflection. However, the piece leans heavily on summary-mode backstory (the Riverside fire, the girl, the marriage collapse) rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final choice feels announced more than tested under live pressure, and the interiority occasionally slips into therapy-speak ("bargained innocence," "translate everyone's pain") that no one would use mid-crisis. The moment where he reframes the crack as "where light got in" edges toward epiphany cliché without sufficient on-page cost to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—revitalizing equations to reconcile divergence—but her characterization leans heavily on abstract conceptual work rather than embodied struggle. The internal contradiction between logical precision and wonder is stated more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's backstory functions as thematic scaffolding but remains distant; Mira's emotional stakes around the fall feel more conceptual than visceral. The final choice to merge timelines arises from insight rather than a trade-off with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her perceptive trait is established through concrete action (feeling vibrations, hearing acoustic signatures). Internal conflict is present but largely told rather than dramatized—the burden of legacy is asserted repeatedly rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The final shift feels more like acceptance of a predetermined path than a choice with visible cost; she doesn't forfeit anything concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vesper's doubled heartbeat trait is established but her choices feel predetermined by the commission structure rather than emerging from contradictory impulses. The interiority leans abstract ("two lives beating as one," "perceptively calm") without embodied contradiction acting in scene. Her final recognition that she's given the city what her sister's death gave her reads as authored insight rather than earned through on-page friction. The motivation is consistent but lacks micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's operational gentleness is dramatized through calibrated speech and clipboard ritual, showing embodied method rather than label. Her seventeen truces and fourteen failures create credible weariness, and the ritual forces commanders to inhabit loss rather than abstraction. Internal contradiction appears in "knowing the lie even as she thought it," and the final assessment "space between one violence and the next" shows earned endurance. Minor deduction: the junior negotiator's question at the end feels like a convenience prompt rather than an organic presence, and some interiority ("operatively gentle—not soft, but deliberately calibrated") edges toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular—"ethics were simply market inefficiencies" feels earned, not therapy-speak. The internal contradiction between his systematic cruelty and sentimental preservation impulse drives the story, though the father's journal and bird-song memories risk sliding into stock backstory. The final choice to release the egg lands with visible cost (seven figures, board incomprehension, empire contradiction), and the renunciation forecloses his prior path. Minor slip: "felt something like grace fracture through him" edges toward label-speak at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Celestine's motivation to defy conformity is established early, but her arc relies heavily on abstract interiority ("bodily poetic grace," "echoes") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice—pulling the final thread—feels predetermined by the setup rather than earned through on-page struggle with competing desires. Embodied emotion is present ("fingers trembling not from cold but from purpose") but diluted by label-heavy phrasing ("no longer chaste in spirit though her body remained her own"). Internal conflict is more conceptual than visceral, limiting agency to a single decision track without genuine cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular in the opening ("silk cravat," "elegant precision," "utterly lifeless"), and the reversal from wielding narrative as weapon to holding space for complexity is earned through the argument catalyst. However, the final transformation feels partially summarized rather than fully embodied—"he understood what he needed to do" tells the epiphany more than showing it through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The puppet work in the dome provides some embodied exploration, but the climactic insight ("holding space for complexity, trusting audiences with ambiguity") reads slightly abstract and lacks the visceral cost or micro-choice that would make the change feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority carries consistent specificity through her architectural philosophy and emotional relationship to extinction. The backstory on her thesis rejection and invented term "esoteric realist" efficiently establishes motivation. The "knot in her chest" easing at the end reads as genuine progression under pressure, though the final benediction moment risks sentiment. Internal contradiction is present but muted—her commitment to impermanence is unwavering rather than tested by a competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior motivation is clearly rooted in grief and the desire to preserve lost names, but her emotional arc relies heavily on summary reflection ("she had forgiven herself only yesterday") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The casting work itself is embodied and specific, yet the final choice feels preordained rather than forced by competing pressures. Her renunciation of silence is emotionally coherent but lacks visible tradeoff or struggle at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's unique perceptual constraint (seeing backward and forward but not present) is established but functions primarily as a metaphysical frame rather than forcing concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to understand why paths choose walkers is declared repeatedly but never dramatized through a live internal conflict or visible cost on the page. The ending shift—"transcending" her fragmented perception—reads as told epiphany rather than earned through embodied struggle; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and the final stance feels bestowed rather than forged by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The astronomer's frugality and devotion are established early and persist, but interiority remains largely assertion-driven rather than embodied contradiction. Her discovery unfolds without genuine internal conflict—no moment where she questions the cost of following the ancient map or doubts her own worthiness to complete this covenant. The final weeping feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the phrase "sealed her covenant" in the penultimate paragraph tilts toward thematic summary instead of dramatized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's seventeen-year patience and pacifist scheming are asserted but her internal contradictions remain abstract—she manipulates through "understanding" yet the mechanics feel declarative rather than embodied. Kale's fury-to-acceptance arc is rapid; the cellular-memory revelation functions as tell-driven epiphany rather than a choice sequence that tests competing impulses. The music-box metaphor does some work, but the brother's sacrifice and Kale's release lack visible on-page cost or friction that would earn the transformation. Interiority leans toward summary and therapeutic phrasing ("release his resentment") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria's motivation to retrieve her brother is clear and her mirror-making craft is sufficiently particularized through the grandmother's teaching and the grinding/mixing sequence. The brother's interiority upon return ("I mapped the spaces between things") feels earned by the sextant repair rather than convenienct. However, his seven-year absence and translucent physicality at the end receive minimal embodied consequence—no struggle with re-entry, no visible cost to his long dissolution. The final handclasp reads solid but the lack of friction or lasting damage from boundary-erasure slightly undercuts the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied contradiction in her belief that "progress meant leaving things behind" while unconsciously keeping the grandmother's grinding stone. The reconciliation moment earns its weight through specific craft detail rather than therapy-speak. Internal conflict shows simultaneous impulses: wanting to modernize while mourning the loss of tradition. The daughter Lena remains somewhat thin—her anger is asserted more than dramatized in contradictory action—but her role as pressure source functions adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's curator identity is established early and her breakthrough follows a consistent pattern (bathroom revelations). Her micro-choices—pacing, cataloging, soaking—show embodied pressure. However, the final acceptance ("she would tend these impossible trees") feels more like settled contemplation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interiority remains abstract at key moments ("disquiet that had settled in her chest"), missing the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marin's motivation to rescue the seventeen is stated but her internal contradiction—scholarly desire versus rescue urgency—never produces a visible on-page choice that costs her something. The time traveler and the seventeen lack distinct interiority; they exist as conceptual vessels. The final negotiation with the bookstore reads as assertion rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal Marin's hierarchy of values under pressure. The "carefully resourceful" trait is labeled (battery life, water, breadcrumb markers) but never constrains a tactical decision where she must sacrifice one resource for another.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is vivid and specific—the chimera-twin memory bleed creates genuine internal contradiction. However, the peak choice ("chose the thread that hurt least") arrives without prior dramatized resistance or competing impulses in that moment; the decision feels asserted rather than fought through. Soren functions more as voice and catalyst than embodied secondary pressure. Embodied emotion is strong in the porthole and mirror beats, weaker when the final pull happens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and consistent (translate confusion into clarity), and her methodical approach is embodied through the rope-work. However, her competence is unbalanced by struggle—she succeeds without meaningful mistakes or blind spots that compound. The "warmly methodical" trait is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses; her interior remains earnest and label-like ("patient observation and adaptable thinking") rather than embodied under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path; the door's accessibility at the end confirms her specialness rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through his navigation of the caves, but his interior life remains thin—we see determination more than contradiction. The mapkeeper role shapes his perception effectively (reading ripple marks, interpreting ice fractals), but the final choice to take the stone feels more inevitable than conflicted. The piece avoids diagnostic language and maintains consistent character knowledge, though the moment of success lacks visible internal cost or trade-off that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Esme's retrocognitive gift is established but functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. Her choice to journey reads as inevitable from the opening rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing desires. The interior relies on elevated diction ("prayers in disguise," "frost flowers") that reads more poetic than character-particular. The pivot from "refused to believe in accidents" to accepting her mission lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elden's interior is present through the "preemptively nostalgic" lens and embodied in gesture (pressing palms, breath catching), but her final choice to merge with the archive feels insufficiently motivated by on-page conflict—it arrives as epiphany rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The predecessor's vanishing is told rather than dramatized, weakening the stakes of her parallel choice. Micro-choices exist (documenting shadows, approaching the central crystal) but they don't visibly foreclose paths or create friction until the ending leap.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's interiority is consistently grounded in embodied habit (the chant, muscle memory with the knot) and his choices under pressure feel earned by prior causality. The woman's motivations are thinner—her burned hands suggest shared history but her role tilts toward sage facilitator rather than crucible. Internal contradiction appears when Kael simultaneously cries and laughs while spinning, a credible collision of relief and grief; the final choice to continue spinning is dramatized rather than declared. Minor deduction for the woman's static function and the slightly telegraphed community-of-artists frame.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Chen's characterization is well-grounded through his observational methods and embodied attention to tidal pools, micro-choices around when to speak, and the tangential approach to difficult truths. Interiority stays concrete ("the particular quality of her silence between words, the way her fingers twisted"). Mira's emotional progression is credible—anger softening through the jade cicada's material weight and her father's finally acknowledging "that wasn't fair to you." Minor slip: Chen's reflection on his decades of work risks sliding into exposition, but it anchors in the present choice to reveal the cicada and remains character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's claustrophobia and her mother's bunker legacy create clear internal contradiction that drives her upward flight. The choice to stay in the sky at the end forecloses the bunker path with visible cost (abandoning maternal expectations). The silence-vessel collection provides embodied particularity, though the porcelain doll's "gilded hush" occasionally slips toward abstract label-speak. Emotional progression through the inversion hour is credible, with contradictory impulses (terror and freedom in the stretching sky) acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marco's motivation to help Elena is clear and his seventeen-year-old experience grounds his competence, but his interior life remains thin—we see his observations and intentions without contradictory impulses or personal cost. Elena's grief is embodied through white knuckles and tears, yet her arc from prison-silence to "possibility" arrives quickly without visible struggle or micro-choices that demonstrate resistance. The hospital-monitor revelation feels like therapeutic self-diagnosis ("That's one sound trying to catalyze all your memories") rather than a painful admission earned through pressure. Marco's pedagogy dominates the beats, leaving Elena more vessel than agent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaida's professional motivation is clear and her arc from cataloger to descender is earned, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The "wisely adventurous certainty" label appears without dramatized tension between caution and risk. The final choice to descend feels inevitable rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Emotional states are asserted more than shown through contradictory bodily experience.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life is clear—her deliberate burning of bridges and role as shadow keeper—but her present-scene choices lack moment-to-moment contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The girl's scar-lattice backstory is vivid yet her interiority remains thin; we see her need but not the warring forces within her during the encounter. The therapy-speak phrases ("self-erasure," "emotional flatlining") label rather than embody emotion at key beats. The final handclasp and teaching offer feel declarative rather than earned through on-page friction between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clearly rooted in her pyramid-scheme past, and the parallel-self chorus provides internal contradiction. However, key choices feel too easy—the "Yes" volunteers her without dramatized hesitation, and the bolt installation succeeds through assertion ("impossible was just another word") rather than embodied struggle. The final pocket-and-move lacks visible cost; she walks toward the next mission with wonder intact, no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cassian's motivation is clear and rooted in penance, but his interior voice remains consistent without contradiction across the piece—he moves from intuition to discovery to resolve in a smooth, rational arc that lacks genuine internal conflict. The decision to bring the cylinder to the tribal council is stated as inevitable rather than dramatized as a choice with competing pulls. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feelings are labeled ("understanding flooding through him like cold water") rather than shown through physical sensation or contradictory impulse. The progression reads as fulfillment of premise rather than a character under pressure making a costly choice that forecloses other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The knight's internal contradiction—seeing strings yet choosing to dance—emerges through action and embodied decision. The "shivering bliss" moment reads as earned through the pattern work, and his motivation shifts credibly from withdrawal to participation. However, the interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("capturing the shape of possibility") that strains against crisis-mode psychology, and the backstory block (investiture memory) occupies ~15% without sufficient micro-choices anchoring it to present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miriam's interiority is concrete and embodied ("chest tightened," the physical handling of the button), and her renunciation of personal wholeness in favor of archival witness is earned through prior causality. The backstory regarding Thomas is efficient and anchors her emotional stance without flattening present pressure. Minor slip: the final reflection ("Her own heart remained broken, perhaps always would") edges toward summary-label rather than embodied contradiction, but the archival micro-choices (cross-referencing, contacting the historical society) redeem agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and her underestimation functions as survival tactic, but her choices feel more procedural than internally conflicted—she photographs, packs, and escapes without a moment of genuine hesitation or contradictory impulse. The resistance work is carefully motivated, yet the final descent into the vault reads as tactical retreat rather than a choice that forecloses a visible cost or reveals hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is present in the crouch and the freeze, but the piece favors observational competence over messy internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and voice-specific, with embodied emotion ("trembled slightly," "pressed against his chest"). The grandmother's coded warnings create genuine internal contradiction between skepticism and belief that drives his choice to play. However, the piece relies heavily on reflection about past emotional states rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the present scene. The final choice feels somewhat preordained by the setup rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miren's motivation to decode the messages is clear and sustained, with concrete micro-choices (charting positions, prodding the speck). However, the transformation lacks embodied contradiction—she moves fluidly through obsession without visible struggle or competing impulses. The final state ("She had become the message") is asserted rather than earned through on-page renunciation or cost. Interior voice remains consistent but leans toward poetic abstraction ("mossy delight," "hush where past meets prophecy") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority shows concrete particulars—"uncertainly certain about which spring needed tension"—and his final choice to preserve fractures rather than restore function demonstrates character evolution. However, his motivation remains largely abstract until the admiral's chamber; the seven years of collecting are summarized rather than tested under pressure. The embodied contradiction of trusting uncertainty is strong at closure, but the middle beats lean on summary ("people said he was hiding") without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her "luminous regret" anchored to her sister's death gives weight to her choices. The micro-choice to speak Celestine's name three times and the decision to walk through rain to deliver the coin both feel earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her reputation for balance and tonight's solitary, grief-driven work. The magistrate's final acceptance forecloses the path of suspended hope with visible cost, meeting the endurance/renunciation standard.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("modestly fearless in the way of those who've faced death enough to know its textures"). The lost soul collector's motivation to weave laughter into healing is shown through active choice—shifting melody to find absurdity in the shade's confession. Internal conflict emerges when she laughs through tears, embodying contradictory impulses. The shade's transformation feels earned by her tactical shift, though his final release lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path for Kael herself.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sera's proprioceptive enhancement is embodied through concrete sensory experience (feeling sap, electromagnetic signatures, Fibonacci spirals) that drives her present actions. Her obsession with quantifying mercy creates genuine internal tension between her compulsive calculation and desire for peace. The old man functions well as pressure and guide. Minor slip: the shift from defensive tension to acceptance happens quickly, though the clearing's harmonic design motivates it; the final "terrifying possibility of peace" captures contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's core motivation is clear and her choice to mount the exhibition earns the ending, but much remains told rather than enacted—her grandmother's teachings are summarized, her work process with the paintings is compressed into a single paragraph, and the interior contradictions that drive transformation feel muted. The child/grandmother frame at the end gestures at embodied stakes but does not dramatize a moment of genuine struggle or renunciation. Emotional progression reads clean but lacks the layered contradiction that would lift it above competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is character-particular—"grateful for the silence that allowed him to hear what really mattered"—and his micro-choices (climbing to investigate, promising the ghost) are motivated by established traits. However, the internal contradiction is mild; he's stopped being frightened years ago, which flattens tension. The daughter reflection ("ever since his daughter asked him why…") provides backstory that primes his drive to discover hidden things, anchoring present action. Emotions are embodied ("feeling the weightless burden"), though the final promise feels slightly easy without visible cost beyond his time.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation to preserve stasis is clear and her shift toward risk feels earned by the operator's intervention and the bottled whisper reveal. However, her interiority remains somewhat abstract—"she'd trained herself not to notice" tells rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The operator is cryptic by design but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle; he functions more as catalyst than character with competing wants. Micro-choices under pressure are present but could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kasimir's interiority is concrete and embodied through his revolutionary past informing present choices. His shift from "revolution as destruction" to "making cathedrals from shards" earns the ending stance through accumulated particulars. The grandmother's mirror superstition functions as genuine character texture rather than exposition. Minor slip: the realization about "honoring what broke" could have landed more obliquely without the explicit "he was only now learning" frame.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aldric's motivation is clear and his technical competence well-established through specific action (jeweler's loupe examination, meteoric tuning fork). The forget-me-not serves as an external compass rather than forcing internal contradiction, which flattens his interior conflict. The peak choice—completing the transmutation rather than simple removal—shows professional judgment but lacks visceral cost or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Minor craft debt: "worry-worn eyes" is a stock descriptor that doesn't reveal the duchess through Aldric's particular lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and specific ("sensibly eccentric," bottling petrichor, psychometry), and her final choice to wade into the lagoon is earned by her established traits and Henrik's precedent. The psychometry readings provide embodied access to Henrik's determination without overt exposition. Internal contradiction is present in the tension between her practical side (pharmaceutical contracts, geological maps) and her belief that "water remembered what touched it," driving her deeper despite surface-world ties. The final renunciation—removing boots, leaving the compass—forecloses return with visible cost, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's motivation is concrete—hunting driftwood, seeking simplicity that scaffolds complexity—and her discovery of the lantern slide forces a micro-choice to reimagine her approach. Internal contradiction appears when she realizes reduction alone isn't enough; she must embrace transparency and layered history. The final decision to ignore GPS and "navigate by older alliances" carries conceptual cost (abandoning modern convenience) but feels more thematic declaration than embodied struggle. Interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-song of time") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's internal progression from viewing night-blooming flowers as defiant to understanding them as moon-rooted is rendered through concrete choices—arranging postcards, studying windows, gathering them with new purpose. The grandmother's handwriting provides a micro-turn that tilts Mara's stance, and the final mural concept represents a foreclosed path with visible cost (abandoning her prior artistic approach). Father Benedict functions adequately to apply pressure through dialogue, though his perceptual signature remains generic. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and grounds emotion in physical action (touching postcards, standing, gathering), earning the mid-7s despite minimal embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Malik's motivation is coherent and his decision to look into the lagoon demonstrates genuine agency with cost. However, his interior life relies on elevated, abstract phrasing ("searing reverie," "terrible logic") that distances rather than embodies his emotional state under pressure. Sarai's three-year imprisonment is declared but not dramatized through choice or visible struggle; her white hair and bitterness are told markers. The final covenant feels more thematic statement than earned character collision—neither resists, neither bargains, and the weight of their choice is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miranda's interior landscape shows purposeful work: she rejects guild illusions, then builds methodology through memory rather than force. Her agency drives the revival through conceptual labor. However, the final passage ("people who rejected easy consolations") tells rather than dramatizes the gathering, and her internal contradictions remain understated—the choice to keep the bottle sealed lacks visible cost or conflicted impulse in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear but remains largely static—he's drawn, watches, receives, and returns without genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Madame Verity is more label than lived experience; her traits (selective muteness, ancient languages) are declared rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The twenty-year jump summarizes transformation rather than dramatizing a key choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the "unlock in his chest" reads as abstract rather than particular.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical concepts ("furiously tranquil," "temporal mass," "texture of borrowed time") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The grandmother's vortex inheritance provides motivation, but the critical choice to step into the spiral arrives without visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Emotional progression reads as smooth acceptance rather than contradictory desires wrestling in scene. The final planting gesture feels more symbolic than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is concrete and embodied—her choice to override the automated system follows from seven years of sensory training. Her hands-on expertise and resistance to false alarms ground her decision at the climax. Internal contradiction is minimal; she is competent but the rope's vibration provides genuine discovery rather than convenient omniscience. The backstory (seven years, eleven deaths) primes her present stance without flattening momentum, and the final beat earns her quiet validation with visible cost (cracked buttresses, sustained effort).

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is consistently filtered through her solitary existence and spiritual lens, but her motivations remain largely static across seven years. The piece tells us she fled "noise and certainty" and "pretended to be" someone else, yet these backstory assertions never pressure present choices—she's already arrived at her philosophy before page one. Embodied contradiction is absent; she experiences no impulse to contact Earth, question her isolation, or resist her routine. The final logging entry ("Beautiful. Necessary. Brief enough to matter") reads as an epiphany label rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority shows through perception ("tranquilly perceptive," reading "dust patterns"), but her motivations remain largely asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The decision to open the box arrives without visible internal friction—she "knew she shouldn't" but proceeds with minimal cost shown on the page. The spirits are vivid in their silent testimony, yet their transformation at the end hinges on witnessing rather than Mara's agency, leaving her role more observational than transformative. Embodied emotion is present in careful gestures but therapy-adjacent phrasing like "self-imposed prison" dilutes the specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to preserve old temporal understanding is clear and consistent, though her choices remain largely observational rather than decisively tested. Internal contradiction appears briefly in "mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived," showing some complexity. The visitor and group members function adequately but apply minimal pressure. Emotional embodiment is present in moments like tracing the gold lettering, but the final gathering lacks a defining choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority shows strong perceptual filtering through her poet's lens ("precise moment when darkness surrendered to light"), and embodied micro-choices (wading in for the feather, giving it to the boy). The boy's grief is handled with specificity rather than therapy-speak. However, Maren's transformation from observer to active witness feels somewhat predetermined by her backstory rather than tested under fresh pressure; her mother's death provides the key insight rather than the present encounter forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her systematic caretaking trait is embodied through concrete actions (wrapping copper wire, opening channels, transplanting fungi). The interiority remains contemplative rather than conflicted—her "brazen calm" operates as a stable emotional posture throughout, with no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The terminal diagnosis provides a time constraint but doesn't generate internal friction or force difficult trade-offs between competing desires. Her final choice to write in the diary and position it for discovery feels thematically appropriate but lacks the weight of a decision that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's shift from "luminous skeptic" to "reluctant pilgrim" is earned through her daily walks and growing feeling toward homecoming. Her interior contradictions are embodied—attempting clinical analysis while viscerally experiencing repetition's weight. The alien Quorum remains functionally thin, serving primarily as philosophical interlocutor rather than applying independent pressure. Elara's micro-choices (bringing the amber, acknowledging her transformation) constrain the ending stance with visible cost to her academic detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and present—transforming battlefield to garden—but his interiority remains thin. He moves through practiced ritual without internal contradiction or visible struggle; the work feels rote rather than conflicted. The bird-communication gift is label-only; we're told he "always understood their calls" but never see him wrestle with ambiguous messages or make a difficult interpretive choice. The grandmother backstory anchors his skill but adds no present friction or micro-choice that changes his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Calder's motivation to decode the cylinders is clear and his transformation from resignation to purpose is earned through the discovery. Mercy functions more as witness than agent; her nose-work creates the inciting turn but thereafter she observes rather than decides. The interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("distance is what killed us") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to organize the settlement feels sudden—no on-page resistance or cost dramatizes what Calder surrenders or risks by sharing the coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's immunity to time dilation is established and motivates her remaining on the station, but her interior life leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final moment shows her drawing "not the stars as they appeared, but the paths they traced through time itself," which gestures at transformation, but the choice itself is announced rather than tested under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse—most beats describe her actions (tracing fingers, positioning herself) without visceral contradiction or cost. The ending's "blessed pariah" reframe feels more like thematic summary than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's transformation from thief-collector to secret-trader is signaled early and his final choice to descend "with open arms" is earned by the guardian encounter. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("apprenticed himself to wonder," "cautious abandon") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The guardian's role as catalyst is clear, but her function feels more symbolic than pressuring; the chess-piece reveal operates as exposition rather than a choice-forcing beat. Emotional progression is present but smoothed by elevated diction that distances us from visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to document "small gestures" is stated early and shapes her walking-word ritual, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract—we get reflective observations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The crisis-actor backstory provides ironic weight ("now no one believed her testimony"), yet this conflict never forces an on-page choice that narrows her options. The archivist arrives as a convenient ally rather than applying secondary pressure, and the partnership forms without friction or visible cost to Mira's solitary practice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly textured through mercury-glass metaphor and embodied choices (pressing the stone into her chest, choosing not to substitute vision for reality). However, the transformation reads as self-narrated epiphany rather than embodied struggle—"she understood now" and similar constructions tell the reader what she's learning instead of letting micro-choices reveal it. The final act of acceptance carries conceptual weight but lacks visible tradeoff; we don't see what she forfeits or what concrete path closes when she embeds the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Petrov's motivation is clear and his internal progression from shame to self-forgiveness is traced through concrete actions (decoding the tapestry). The embodied fidgeting establishes character particularity early. However, the final epiphany—"how to forgive the player behind the pieces"—slides into abstraction without a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The duchess memory functions more as explanatory backstory than a present-tense contradiction that complicates his stance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's artistic defiance is established early and her internal conflict—guilt over her brother's death versus her need for complexity—shapes choices throughout. The tension between her artistic soul and the demand for simple confession is embodied, though the ten-year-old detail arrives late and somewhat deflates the moral weight. Her final whispered line "I forgive you" shows ambiguity but the path to that moment feels more intellectual than viscerally earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's oxygen-debt urgency and grandmother's kintsugi philosophy ground her choices in embodied pressure and inherited values. The final descent shows earned transformation through specific action rather than epiphany. However, interiority occasionally slips into therapeutic abstraction ("meaning crystallized like gold in broken places") and the leap to full certainty ("newly certain of her purpose") arrives too cleanly after one contact point. The contradictory impulses of doubt versus desperate hope are present but could act more simultaneously in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior life is established through concrete observation patterns and the mirror-as-turning-point reads earned. The promise made at twenty-three provides clear motivation, and the final realization about brokenness and intimacy shows genuine shift. However, the epiphany arrives through extended reflection rather than dramatized contradiction—"she understood that the hidden promise...wasn't about creating one perfect masterpiece" tells more than it costs. The choice to leave the easel and distribute shells demonstrates agency, but the emotional progression from detachment to presence lacks sufficient on-page friction or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her actions align with her beliefs about "screaming tenderness," but her interior life relies heavily on reflective exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choices (polishing the lens, placing the soil, adjusting the pulse) serve the concept more than reveal genuine internal conflict. Thomas functions as a foil but exerts minimal pressure; his conversion feels unearned because we never see him truly resist or force Mira into a hard trade-off. The final smile and the peaceful resolution lack visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no genuine struggle dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied through the patchwork jacket, calloused fingers, and sternum-pull sensation. The progression from observer to builder to understanding is earned through on-page physical engagement with objects. Internal conflict operates through contradictory pulls—the reverse migration's tug versus her need to navigate what remains—without therapy-speak. The final choice to "build in earnest" for future navigators forecloses passivity with visible cost, though the brother/mother losses feel briefly mentioned rather than charged throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's shift from isolation to creating community space shows motivation, but the arc feels schematic. Her interior contradiction—rational forager who dismisses superstition yet enables it—is told more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The reconciliation scenes are summarized ("Henrik reconciled with his daughter") rather than dramatized with visible struggle. The final realization about rationality and human need arrives as an epiphany without prior embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Magnus's interiority is filtered through his profession ("observed the world by noting what wasn't there") and embodied choices like pinning the Edelweiss to his coat. However, his contradiction—a man who tends light but investigates darkness—never creates genuine friction or error; he moves through the mystery with unearned certainty. The reflective mode dominates (past about the old woman, backstory of the stranger) and although anchored to present stimuli, it flattens present-moment pressure. The final gesture (pinning the flower, promising to investigate coordinates) feels more thematic statement than choice with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Martin's interior life is consistently rendered through his relationship with maps and solitude, and the grandmother's deathbed instruction anchors his present search with concrete motivation. The cavern sequence shows genuine uncertainty—he examines the chip, follows ants, tests the wall—building to a choice that forecloses his settled loneliness. However, the visions of alternate lives feel like convenient exposition rather than embodied pressure, and the final paragraph lists possible actions (shop sign, travelers' club, nephew) without committing to one, diluting the cost of his shift. The embodied work is solid but the closure choice remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's interior journey from disenchantment to self-witness is legible, with embodied emotion in the cold-burn starlight and synchronized breathing. However, key moments lean on label-speak ("disenchanted," "calcified heart," "capable of wonder") rather than fully dramatized contradictions. The final decision to descend carrying starlight "like a wound that might, finally, teach her how to heal" reads as therapeutic summary rather than a choice with visible on-page cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Solène's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is established early and drives her revaluation project, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("the weight of a moment," "texture of this twilight") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of pressing the sphere into Mira's palm carries cost (risking rejection by the Academy), but the decision feels more like thesis demonstration than genuine struggle between competing goods. Mira functions primarily as audience for exposition rather than applying independent pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("doubt and hope braided together") but not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior contradiction—her professional skill at ordering others' chaos versus her inability to stabilize her own timeline—generates credible pressure. The jealousy of past selves is embodied through scrolls and recursive memory loops, though the emotional specificity occasionally drifts into diagnostic label-speak ("chronologically confused," "feral nostalgia" as named concepts rather than dramatized states). Her endurance and continued scroll-keeping reflect earned stasis, foreclosing hope of cure with visible cost. The phrase "chronologically confused—it sounded less clinical, more like a personality quirk than a curse" reads as self-aware hedging that slightly undercuts raw interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's shift from aromatherapist to clock repairer is grounded in concrete loss, and her perception of the screw's emotional terrain shows character-specific insight. However, the final choice—advising Mrs. Kapoor to keep the clock broken—feels more like therapeutic wisdom-dispensing than a decision with visible cost to Elena herself. The internal arc registers as observation and interpretation rather than a choice that forecloses a path for the protagonist. Mr. Chen remains functional but static, existing primarily to frame Elena's insights.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction—scholarly training versus "small magics"—drives the crystallization crisis and resolution cleanly. The embodied fear response (hands turning to quartz) is specific and constrains action with visible cost. Grandmother's voice provides motivation without therapy-speak, and the final choice to trace runes is earned by the prior struggle. Minor slip: the scars-as-text metaphor edges toward over-articulation in the penultimate paragraph but doesn't flatten the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's internal progression from cruel columnist to grief-translator is embodied through concrete choices—deleting her article, writing the truth—and the perfume bottle moment carries contradictory emotion ("jasmine and regret"). The reflection on being "frozen" reads a touch diagnostic but anchors in present cues and drives the apology. Vivienne manifests through rage and paper but her interiority is accessed via "induced current," which straddles metaphor and actual presence; the mechanism holds under the story's logic. Minor: the "mechanical conductor" backstory could be more particular to avoid stock setup.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's role as "end of history witness" is declared but her interior experience remains abstract—phrases like "feeling time fold around her like origami" and "consciousness expanded outward" substitute metaphor for embodied contradiction. The walking meditation produces a smooth epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path; she "becomes part of the spiral" without dramatized struggle or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Her motivation to "unravel cosmic illusions" is told rather than tested through on-page friction, and the final transformation reads as serene absorption rather than a choice with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her decision to turn the key demonstrates contradictory impulses—scientific rigor versus transgressive experimentation. The embodied cost (bloodied fingers) and her realization that she must "shepherd" rather than measure time shows earned change. Internal contradiction operates in scene when she simultaneously seeks absolute understanding yet discovers the universe "preferred chaos." Minor slip: the final insight about "humanity's desperate agreement" edges toward articulated epiphany rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's internal contradiction between teaching probability and seeking certainty in chaos is dramatized through on-page micro-choices (documenting subway symbols, searching philosophy texts, deciding to visit the hospital). Her relationship with her father is shown through specific, embodied details (the hospital bracelet, the pattern of never questioning him). However, the epiphany moment—"she could choose to see that as another spin of the wheel, or as a second chance"—arrives through reflection rather than being earned by a concrete scene pressure, and the final paragraph's resolution feels summarized rather than enacted with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sarah's interiority is concrete and specific ("touching the glass harmonica disc, its cold surface grounding her"), with embodied contradictions driving the protocol-break choice. The elderly caller's motivation is economically sketched yet sufficient to create pressure. Minor deduction: the supervisor's termination threat is asserted rather than dramatized through prior consequence, and Sarah's final shift to "invitation" feels slightly under-earned given three years of adherence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is textured and specific—brown-stained hands, magnifying-glass precision—but her emotional arc leans too much on told epiphany rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization ("I kept everything") feels asserted rather than wrestled with under pressure. Returnees remain decorative; their presence validates her work but doesn't force a genuine choice with visible cost. No micro-choices that foreclose a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara's "desperately jocular" mask is label-only until Emil names it, then it's credited to others off-page; we never witness her perform this trait under pressure in scene. The seventeen relief workers arrive as a collective with minimal individuated choices—Yuki, Marcus, and Seraphine are named but never speak or act, so the cast feels like a roster rather than a crucible. The ending shift from motion to staying is asserted ("choosing, finally, to stay found") rather than dramatized through a visible on-page cost or renunciation that forecloses the nomadic path. Interior contradiction and embodied struggle are absent; Mara's loneliness is told and the "cure" is summarized in the final paragraphs without a choice that costs her something live on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's motivation to map her grief is clearly established and her blindness shapes her perceptual signature throughout. However, the "recognition burned through her chest" epiphany at the stillpoint feels somewhat declarative rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. The sister's melody arrives as convenient emotional trigger rather than emerging from established internal conflict. Micro-choices under pressure are present (following the trail, kneeling) but the final understanding resolves too neatly without visible cost to a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority shows concrete embodiment through the pen-handling worry ritual and her fingers stilling at the discovery. Her shift from filtering noise to cataloging changes demonstrates agency with visible cost—she releases "rigid certainty" and accepts living "between drafts." The predecessor's disappearance provides character-specific backstory that primes the closure choice. Minor slip: "confident uncertainty" arrives as inherited label rather than fully dramatized contradiction, though the pen-unbending does enact the paradox physically.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority shows concrete embodiment ("tears on her cheeks, that peculiar sensation of joyful sorrow") and her motivation to map silence is rooted in lived isolation. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on summary ("feeling erased, forgotten") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Theo remains functionally one-note—supportive advisor without internal conflict or visible cost to his labor. The final choice (joining Theo to adjust parameters) lacks a genuine trade-off or foreclosed path; Marina's renunciation of permanence is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that alters present options.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is established through backstory (Kenji's grandmother, the vandalized portrait) but remains largely told rather than tested on the page. The cave sequence lacks meaningful choice under pressure—she documents, photographs, and weeps, but no opposition or internal friction emerges. The "volcanic tenderness" emotional note feels asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final walk toward judgment is declared but not dramatized with visible cost in the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marquez and Theo's entanglement creates interesting internal friction, particularly in the drumming motif that embodies their merged habits. However, interiority leans toward philosophical abstraction ("causality itself seemed negotiable") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to "lean into the entanglement" feels declared more than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices are present but the cost of this transformation remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus shows clear competence through his map-folding system and ability to read the labyrinth's patterns, with his choice to use sound rather than force at the keyhole moment demonstrating character-specific problem-solving. However, the final "welcome to the inner circle" resolution feels unearned—we don't see Marcus struggle with contradictory impulses or pay a visible cost for his admission. The woman's arrival and immediate validation flattens what could have been a more complex test of his methods. Internal conflict remains largely absent; Marcus moves through the maze with confident expertise rather than genuine doubt or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation to protect the canal community while preserving her guild position creates clear internal conflict, and her micro-choices with the mirror signal embodied decision-making. However, the guardian remains purely observational—his "spiralingly calm" precision is label-only, and he makes no on-page choices that alter tactics or outcomes. The final walk home delivers reflection rather than a dramatized renunciation or acceptance of specific cost (she keeps her job, the message spreads without her exposure), so the claimed "half-spoken secret" burden feels asserted rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miss Chen's interiority is selective and consistent—her hearing "unspoken words" filters Danny's hesitation through a specific perceptual lens. The chess-coach role and her grandmother's phrase anchor her stance, but Danny's turn from quitting to joining the grotto feels unmotivated by on-page pressure; his shift occurs through persuasion rather than internal contradiction. The father's fear is told, not dramatized, and Danny's final choice lacks visible cost—he announces intention without forfeiting anything concrete. Embodied emotion is present in gestures (cradling the queen, touching the window) but remains gestural rather than fully contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior voice shows distinct texture ("brutal tenderness of denying yourself") and embodied contradiction when facing the choice. Kael's wound-concealing swagger and his final tearing admission "I'm not my father" feel earned. However, the epiphany moment—"understanding blooming like bioluminescence"—tips into stock metaphor, and the final decision arrives without sufficient prior cost: neither character's obligations receive on-page friction that would make "detaching together" painful in real time. The transformation reads declared more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's narration habit is well-motivated as resistance that persists after the mandate, and his internal conflict between performance and grief is embodied through the whittling and flower-tending. Emma's blank performer's mask and her slow thaw are legible, though her arc is more observed than driven by her own choices. The final moment—"muscles remembering expressions they'd suppressed"—earns the shift through prior constraint, and the cost of years suppressed is felt. Minor: the morally-ambiguous attribute (prompt element) is stated rather than dramatized in a choice with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Meris is present and motivated, but her interiority is largely declaration rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. "The tremor of certainty" and "visceral knowledge" read as label-only claims rather than embodied contradiction. The final stance—striding through boundaries—feels asserted rather than earned through on-page cost or renunciation that forecloses a visible path. Kael exists only to deliver exposition and has no independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is embodied through her texture-based perception and the colorblindness anchors her artistic method, but her motivation and stakes remain largely asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. The bartering transaction with Tomás reads functional but not deeply conflicted—she identifies what she needs and he acquiesces without pressing friction. Internal complexity is suggested ("being broken by the world was just another way of being beautiful") but this epiphany arrives as a thematic claim rather than earned through on-page struggle. The piece avoids label-speak yet lacks the visceral cost of a protagonist wrestling with genuine blind spots or compounding mistakes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior life shows embodied texture—the crystalline chimes and her evolving relationship to them anchor her transformation. The volunteer's arrival and his visible shift (shoulders drop, face softens) provide a modest secondary pressure point, though his interiority remains thin. The final realization ("she'd been seeking connection's texture not to study it, but to share it") feels slightly over-articulated and diagnosed rather than discovered through concrete micro-choices. Maren's motivations cohere and the ending choice (sharing versus studying) is earned, but the epiphany statement edges toward label-speak at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's journey from grief to mentorship shows clear internal progression, and her teaching of Senna demonstrates consistent motivation. However, key emotional beats rely on therapeutic language ("that particular species of brokenness," "permission to feel") that distances rather than embodies. The final choice to continue mentoring feels inevitable rather than hard-won, lacking visible internal contradiction at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vesper's interiority is present but relies heavily on exposition about her research methods rather than embodied contradictory impulses in the scene. Her "steadily curious" trait is more label than lived contradiction—we see patient observation but no moment where curiosity costs her something or forces a difficult micro-choice under pressure. Marcus arrives with a "haunted look" but his emotional progression through the night remains abstract; the collaborative epiphany feels convenient rather than earned through character friction. The shift from cartomancer-as-charlatan survival to legitimate decoder happens too smoothly without visible renunciation or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's motivation is clear and her pursuit of forbidden knowledge drives choices, but interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("atoms of nostalgia," "essence-memories") rather than embodied contradictions. The decision to return and teach the Council arrives without visible internal struggle in the closing beat—she moves from absorption to resolution too smoothly. Emotional progression shows anguished joy throughout but lacks micro-choices that test competing impulses on the page. The final stance feels announced rather than earned through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's interior life shows texture through professional expertise and the grandmother's memory, but her decision to copy old files lacks genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The choice feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page friction between competing goods. Her "softly deliberate certainty" describes a fait accompli instead of dramatizing the cost of foreclosing alternative paths. The grandmother's dream carries weight, but Sera's present-tense emotional complexity remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's interior contradiction—genuine observation versus falsified data—drives her choices with consistent specificity. Her motivation to balance self-respect and compassion is embodied in concrete micro-choices: retrieving the field journal, creating the new document title, speaking to the chameleon. The final decision to "try again honestly" feels earned by the prior pressure, with visible cost (acknowledging mistakes, accepting reduced academic prestige). Minor slip: the phrase "building something fragile but genuine from the wreckage" edges toward therapeutic self-awareness that slightly smooths the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interior contradictions are embodied through self-harm and plant communion—"how could she learn to read their stories if she kept them covered"—but the interiority occasionally tips into label-speak ("accidentally telepathic") and over-articulated realization. The final choice to christen the hourglass with blood is earned by prior causality and forecloses pursuit for justice, visible cost present. Dr. Venn remains functional but flat, his betrayal revealed rather than dramatized in present pressure. Micro-choices (picking scars, pressing hourglass to wrist) reveal hierarchy of values under the meteor's constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celeste's motivation is clear and she pursues it methodically, but her internal landscape remains thin—no contradictory impulses complicate her quest, and the ease with which she interprets the psychometric vision borders on competence without struggle. The projectionist and dancer exist only in backstory summary; their unuttered love is told rather than embodied in a choice that costs Celeste something on the page. The final decision to redistribute the film strips feels generous but arrives without visible friction or a hierarchy of competing values that would charge the moment with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celestine's journey has clear motivation (freeing the Keeper to free herself), but her internal contradiction feels asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The moment she "understood with the peculiar clarity" bypasses earned discovery; her choice to "deliberately introduce imperfection" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed options. The Keeper's backstory is vivid but remains told rather than tested through present conflict. The final "moonstruck dreamer no longer" reads as therapy-speak epiphany rather than embodied renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior is richly textured through voice ("names meant less now that reality had begun to fracture") and her micro-choices (approaching with eyes half-closed, speaking the charm) reveal her relationship to this world. However, the protagonist remains observational through much of the piece; her agency crystallizes only in the charm sequence, and the final choice feels more like ritual completion than a decision under competing pressures. The embodied contradiction needed to push this higher—wanting versus fearing, or a visible cost that forecloses a path—is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The philosopher's motivations are abstractly stated ("wild frontier of the mind") but never tested through competing wants or internal contradiction. His nightly translocations feel convenient rather than consequential—no embodied fear, confusion, or micro-choices that show him wrestling with this bizarre phenomenon. The ending accepts his condition without visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply continues. Interiority leans toward exposition ("the ability to think beyond the prison of conscious logic") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority shows embodied contradiction—she feels both terrified and lighter when the leash breaks. The guides feel more symbolic than individuated, delivering thesis-adjacent wisdom rather than pursuing their own goals. The confession scene ("told them about the job she'd refused...") compresses years into summary rather than letting one micro-choice reveal her pattern. The final choice to run forward is earned by the prior reflection, but the therapeutic precision ("unused courage") edges toward label-speak at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rielle's journey shows embodied physical sensation ("pins and needles blossoming into crude sensation") and her motivation to understand cost drives choices throughout. Silent-Choir demonstrates consistent character particularity through action rather than exposition—his muteness is dramatized, not merely stated. The final piano-playing scene delivers earned agency: Rielle chooses to remain and play despite pain, accepting the cost of survival. Minor deduction for Silent-Choir's trauma being gestured at but never concretized enough to test his own hierarchy of values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ossian's motivations are consistent—guarding truth across eons—but his interior life remains thin. We see patient watchfulness and a "smallest smile," but no embodied contradiction or struggle under pressure. The pretender exists only as an abstract threat rewritten in margins; no secondary character appears on the page to test Ossian's values. His final act feels like executing a known procedure rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and observational—her tapping habit and data-driven thinking feel earned. The realization about Morse code arrives via direct epiphany rather than pressure-driven contradiction; her grandfather's habit is told rather than shown acting on her present choices. Internal conflict is minimal: she moves smoothly from observation to insight without competing impulses or visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion appears mainly in "racing heart," leaning on stock phrases rather than character-particular sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kess displays consistent interiority through her barefoot wandering and pattern-seeking, but her epiphany arrives through observation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "awkwardly confident" trait is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final resolve to gather others and teach them feels declared rather than earned by prior internal conflict with visible cost—she moves from solitary observation to collective mission without foreclosing a competing path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Naja's arc from insurgent to bridge-builder is clear, and her contradictory impulses—resistance versus evolution—act simultaneously when she chooses to unseal the embryo despite uncertainty. Her embodied experience in the hot springs and the sensory weight of the spores sinking into her skin ground key beats. However, the transformation's internal cost remains abstract; we see her gain communion with plants but the text skips the visceral price of hosting alien genetic material, and the final paragraph's confident stride ("already sensing which survivors carried the genetic potential") reads as immediate mastery rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is well-embodied through somatic markers (helicopter thrum locks knees, jasmine tightens throat), and her motivations are consistent. The internal contradiction between grief and cultivation creates genuine tension that drives micro-choices throughout. However, the final transplant metaphor feels slightly didactic, and some therapeutic framing ("somatic markers," "the pearl of stillness") borders on over-articulated self-awareness during what should be lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The artist's interiority shows some embodied emotion ("hollowed, scraped clean of purpose") and the decision to complete the card spiral under physical threat demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the central transformation—from painting rejected portraits to "portraits of the spaces between"—arrives as an epiphanic leap rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The backstory about rejected commissions establishes motive but remains expository; micro-choices during the card arrangement lack visible internal friction or cost that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially his "serene anger" and embodied sensory filtering through albino vulnerability. His motivation to track Vera is clear, rooted in justice and personal history, and the final choice to "let the ink patterns finish forming" shows contradictory impulses—hunter respecting prey—without therapy-speak. Vera's backstory is concise and her motivations land, though her self-defense claim is told rather than tested. The closure choice feels earned by prior causality, but the cost is muted—Kael's anger remains unchanged, and no live option is visibly foreclosed beyond a few seconds' delay.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior conflict is established early and her micro-choices under pressure (hovering over the panel, recording her decision) embody her contradictory impulses. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("What do we owe the truth when survival depends on forgetting?") rather than concrete, embodied emotion at the peak moment. The final choice to wake one witness feels motivated, but the cost registers more as declaration ("ending her own life as she'd known it") than visceral consequence in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied through her work with plants, and her final micro-choice (offering tea, the cutting) alters the relationship with visible cost—she stops watching him decide, accepting his autonomy. Kael's blade-sheathing as embodied emotion is effective. The backstory about the mother is purposeful and anchored in present stimuli (the plant he touches). Minor: "senselessly perceptive" is labeled rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and specific—her cool-headedness under pressure reads as trait, not label. The grandmother's wisdom anchors motivation without becoming therapy-speak. Her choices (driving the spike, shaping the silence, holding still) show embodied decision-making under escalating frequencies. Minor slip: the captured echo's emotional specificity ("being held while falling") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than letting the reader infer, but the cost (it "nests" in her bones) keeps it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celeste's motivation is clear and her intellectual approach is well-rendered through specific actions (pen work, cross-referencing archives). The moment of realization "You clever old ghost" shows earned discovery, but the father remains a construct serving the plot rather than a felt presence—his cowardice-or-calculation question is answered too tidily. The decision to publish feels inevitable rather than costly; we don't see what she's risking (circulation, legacy, personal safety) in concrete terms. Interiority leans toward expository philosophizing ("proof by contradiction" becomes a frame rather than embodied struggle) and the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is vivid and guilt-laden, her doctoral work forming a credible backstory that constrains her present choices. The core renunciation—"rewriting her own constellation"—reads as earned by the accumulated guilt, though the phrase "learning to translate its true meaning" edges toward thematic abstraction. Internal conflict is present (research vs. nephew's cry) but mostly told in backstory rather than enacted in present contradiction. The curator and wasp remain functional props rather than pressure sources; no secondary character forces a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Moth's social perceptiveness is shown through concrete sensory experiences ("taste their panic as addresses dissolved"), and her decision to create mandalas demonstrates agency under the unlearning pressure. The old man's hollow eyes and unlearned profession provide embodied emotion. However, the gathering crowd lacks individual differentiation, and Moth's internal contradiction remains understated—she moves through her art-making without visible struggle or competing impulses that would deepen her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Layla's interiority is concrete and her embodied struggle with retrocognitive loops is visceral ("pulling herself free with effort that left her shaking"). The motivation shift from weapon to preserver carries weight, but her internal contradiction—serving the regime that trapped her—lacks dramatized tension in real time; we're told she refused orders in backstory rather than shown wrestling with a live choice. The final act of naming and mosaic-building reads as determined action but doesn't foreclose a visible path with cost; survivors simply emerge to join her without complication. Micro-choices under pressure are present but the stakes of her current defiance remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Margaux's synesthetic perception is vividly rendered ("sound bloomed as color," "applause rippled as waves of golden warmth"), but her motivation to perform remains asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. The fractured timeline creates interiority, yet no moment forces her to choose between competing desires with visible cost—she simply executes her plan. The three audience members appear as passive witnesses rather than complicating her choice, and the final fade feels granted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core motivation (illuminate pathways to save eight hundred trapped souls) is clear and drives her choices, but her internal experience of the static-shock transformation reads more as exposition than embodied contradiction. The moment "I'm not certain of anything anymore" gestures at disorientation, yet her subsequent movements feel controlled and purpose-driven without visible struggle or mistake that would ground the cost of her altered state. Dr. Chen functions primarily as audience stand-in; his "affectionate skeptic" label is told rather than shown through conflicting choices that test their relationship under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("grief pooled in cold pockets," "golden contentment settling") rather than embodied contradiction. The discovery of non-human emotions is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal her values under pressure. Her final "becoming" feels summarized ("She became what she'd sought") instead of enacted through a visible cost that forecloses a path. The elm leaf functions more as a mystical token than a choice-constraining object that tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's initial motivation ("quietly inspired by the work") is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her turn from passive observer to active agent arrives late and feels abrupt—the line "Mara's motivation crystallized" tells rather than shows the shift through on-page contradiction or cost. The realization that accelerating hourglasses signal unraveling truth lacks embodied internal friction; Mara moves smoothly into solution mode without struggle. Desta's role as guide reduces Mara's agency in the discovery phase, limiting the protagonist's ownership of the central insight.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's arc from isolation to purpose is earned through the pillbox discovery and Sarah's final message, but his interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("silver hush," "unused courage waits") rather than embodied contradiction. The epiphany "You were never broken, only afraid" arrives as authorial comfort rather than dramatized realization through prior micro-choices. Emma appears too late and remains functional rather than pressured by her own stake. The final descent feels declared rather than tested by competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's characterization is controlled through precise perceptual selectivity ("ambient awareness," listening to "what went unsaid") and his wisdom is earned through thirty years of observation. The woman's motivation is embodied through nervous finger-work and breath shifts, building to her grandmother's journals revelation. The coachman's final insight—"All of it is true"—lands as earned rather than didactic because it's rooted in his established patience and perceptive authority. Minor deduction: the woman's arc from seeking singular truth to acceptance could show one more micro-choice of resistance before yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The potter's motivation is clear and her observation-focused interiority fits the zen-minded brief, but her agency remains largely passive—she watches, understands, and carries forward without an on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The beekeeper materializes as a guide-figure whose flickering existence is evocative but whose function is primarily expository. Interior contradictions are absent; the potter moves smoothly from seeking to understanding without struggle or competing impulse, which flattens the arc into a spiritual confirmation rather than a hard-won realization.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and specific—her understanding of the rosebush teaching her, the gauge tooth's memorial weight—but the progression from grief to pragmatic hope lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final certainty ("The rosebush would bloom again. She was certain.") feels like unearned epiphany rather than a choice forged under pressure. Micro-choices (adjusting mirrors, watering plants) are present but low-stakes; no single moment forces a trade-off with visible cost. The father's locksmith past enriches texture but remains backstory that tilts present stance only obliquely.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior state is vivid and embodied in early passages ("brittle glass breaking inside her skull"), but the central transformation from isolation to "fierce, unprecedented independence" is largely asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The thylacine memory provides texture but remains ornamental; no concrete decision forces her to choose between her two selves with visible cost. The cataloging work and translation metaphor are told activities that don't narrow options or test her stance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's interiority is concrete and specific—her work translating longing into cursive script, the grammar of desire—and her final choice to add her own letter is earned by the installation's revelatory pressure. The embodied moment of recognition ("Margot's throat tightened") is immediate and particular. Minor weakness: the characterization of Sena remains thin, serving primarily as exposition vehicle, though this doesn't compromise the protagonist's arc or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motives are clear and her astronomical expertise is established, but internal contradiction is minimal—she moves from detection to plan execution without genuine doubt clouding her choices. The "cautiously hopeful" label appears but isn't dramatized through embodied hesitation or visible cost in the peak moment when the tricksters turn their attention on her. Her competence is strong but the struggle feels more conceptual than visceral, and the final choice to "maintain broadcast" lacks the forfeited alternative that would charge it with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's claustrophobia is embodied early ("tightness creeping into her chest") and her "prudently adventurous" nature is shown through twenty years of calculated risk. However, her interior life remains thin at the closure; the final paragraph offers abstract meditation ("honored the wistful rebellion") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The compass as talisman and the organ's instruction provide some embodied choice-making, but the ending renunciation or commitment feels asserted more than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's prosopagnosia is established early and drives her methodology, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract—we're told she "understood dormancy" rather than shown contradictory impulses in action. The interviews with Catherine's friends provide some embodiment through their descriptions, yet Elena's own emotional stakes feel muted; her investment in awakening empathy is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The ending conversation with Morrison lands cleanly, but the protagonist's arc reads more as thematic illustration than a character pulled between competing desires with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to rehabilitate her great-grandfather's memory is clear and drives her choices, but internal contradiction remains thin—her idealism never genuinely conflicts with doubt or fear in a way that complicates action. The "nervously confident" attribute is asserted twice but never embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Dr. Kao functions primarily as a sounding board rather than applying independent pressure that forces Mira to adapt her stance. The final choice to descend feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a safer path.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's observational trait is established but her interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("luminous disbelief coursed through her veins," "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") that reads more like prompt echoes than lived thought. The hitchhiker's vanishing triggers her action, yet her decision to play violin feels unmotivated by prior struggle—no visible trade-off between fear and commitment. The final choice lacks embodied cost; she plays "until sunset" with only "aching bow arm," then packs up and drives on as if the transformative event left no lasting internal scar or change in her relationship to her work.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marco's interiority is concrete and his micro-choices (arranging the bills, installing sensors, offering sanctuary) reveal character under pressure. The father's motivations are traced clearly through the currency collection-as-territorial-markers conceit. However, the father's climactic decision to stay arrives without sufficient internal contradiction or visible cost—he simply agrees after one conversation, flattening what should be a wrenching choice. The "ancient and knotted…loosen" line veers toward label-only emotional summary rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear and embodied through her exhaustion and telegram-holding, but her transformation feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The decision to collaborate arrives smoothly without substantial internal resistance—no dramatized moment where she must choose between Ashwin's solitary path and partnership. Elias's twenty-year isolation is told rather than shown through behavior that would reveal his weight. The final writing session describes shared activity but doesn't show Mara foreclosing a competing path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation (finding lost things as core drive) is clear and her warlike serenity provides consistent texture. The apprentice's arc from frozen terror to gasping confession is dramatized, though his interior contradiction feels more told than shown—the flesh-eating seeds backstory arrives late as exposition rather than discovered tension. Maren's guarded nature is stated but her micro-choices don't reveal competing impulses in action; she operates with professional competence but minimal visible cost to her stance. The final exchange about "refusing to unbend" reads as thematic summary rather than earned insight from prior embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's root-bound visionary trait is established early and her scar-linking choice at the climax demonstrates agency, but interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("dreams grew so dense and tangled") rather than embodied contradiction. The pairing with Marcus feels functional but their relationship pressure is told more than dramatized—we're assured they've "been seeking this intersection for years" without on-page friction testing that bond. The "anxious elation" emotion is declared rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the closure choice (merging consciousness) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is strongly characterized through his desperate bargaining and the visible cost—"hollows beneath his eyes had deepened," the "joy sits wrong...like I swallowed wasps"—embodying the consequences of his reckless idealism. The Moth Oracle's interiority is less developed; her motivations are declared ("promised herself she'd only help people patch holes") rather than tested on the page through contradictory impulses. The final choice to "hold both the light and the dark" is framed by prior causality but lacks a visible micro-choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost in the ending beat. Embodied emotion is strong in Marcus; the Oracle's "fierce gentleness" remains more label than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's interior life is concrete and embodied—touching the grille cloth, trembling hands, eyes closed for tactile judgment. Internal conflict operates well: he recites facts to insulate against fear, then pivots to trusting instinct despite prior failure. The final choice (trusting feel over certainty) is earned by on-page causality and forecloses the path of defensive fact-recitation with visible cost. Minor slip: Sarah's function is purely utilitarian pressure without her own stakes, and the "confidently uncertain" phrase from the station manager feels like imported exposition rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Emilia's motivation is consistent—grief channeled into methodical translation work—and her trained mind plausibly enables the final understanding. However, interiority leans on stock phrasing ("her scientific mind rejected such anthropomorphism," "her methodical nature asserting itself despite grief") and the peak realization arrives as delivered knowledge rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The emotional arc from grief to understanding carries weight but lacks embodied struggle; she remains observant rather than internally conflicted. No major causality break, but the final acceptance feels more receptive than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maris is embodied through tactile anchors (bamboo creel, smelting forge) and her fisherman-to-keeper transformation is motivated. The visitor's arc from uncertainty to recognition reads cleanly, though her shift feels somewhat quick. Interior contradiction appears lightly in Maris's dual impulse to preserve what's gone while accepting the loop, but the visitor's choice to keep the scroll lacks visible cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is present ("something shifted in her expression") but the ending smile trends toward resolution without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's professional detachment transforms into purposeful witness through concrete, on-page discovery of artifacts. His interior voice remains consistent, filtering setting through inspector's eyes ("checking ventilation systems and water supplies"). The final choice to "catalog these objects not as inventory but as testimony" demonstrates clear motivation shift. However, the epiphany arrives somewhat suddenly; the move from clinical detachment to emotional mission could have been grounded in one more micro-choice showing internal resistance before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interior life is concrete and embodied—wading deeper, recording observations, adding graffiti responses—and her hydrologist background shapes her perceptual lens. The medication-stopping frame drives her raw sensory recalibration and her methodical approach creates character-specific tension. However, the final turn ("Subject remains upright") feels more stated than earned by prior on-page struggle; the journey toward self-forgiveness is reflected upon extensively but lacks a decisive interior contradiction forcing a visible choice with cost at closure. Backstory integration is functional but edges close to the reflection ceiling without always tilting present stance through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority remains largely abstract—"cautious exuberance," "cold fire"—without embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's unspoken words provide emotional weight, yet the protagonist's response ("her hands shook") leans toward performed emotion rather than visceral contradiction. The final recognition feels asserted more than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclosed paths with visible cost. Agency at closure reads as comprehension rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interior life is concrete and embodied through her telepathy with plants, coffee-reading method, and touch against the violin. Her final choice—encrypting truth while submitting a stripped report—reflects her values under pressure and forecloses her relationship with institutional legitimacy. However, the decision feels calculated rather than torn; we see the plan more than the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment. The monks and Empire remain abstract pressures rather than embodied relationships that test her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra is rendered with strong embodied specificity—"warming them between her palms," the precise threshold temperature, the practiced micro-choices—and her dual vocation is legible through action rather than exposition. Her interior focus ("that spark, that moment—Lyra had captured it. She always did") shows professional clarity without therapy-speak. The girl remains static by design, so relationship pressure is absent, but Lyra's solitary agency drives every beat. Minor slip: the parents' hollow voices and the emerald handoff feel slightly stock, but they don't undercut Lyra's consistent interiority or the earned ritual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Keiko's internal state is embodied and her reflections on forgiveness and contentment show genuine complexity—she discovers that forgiving didn't solve everything. The woman/mother reveal works cleanly and the final choice to keep the hairpin feels earned. Minor dip: the "vineyard hush" register occasionally elevates vocabulary ("luminous with youth," "umbral grotto") slightly above lived interiority, and the woman's dialogue edges toward thematic statement rather than character-particular speech in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's arc from certainty to embracing doubt is clear and her interiority is concrete in most beats ("the question had wrapped around her like a cloak of doubt"). However, the Vincent backstory—though it provides motivation—functions primarily as exposition rather than lived contradiction acting in scene. The final choice to "offer questions instead of answers" feels articulated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses at the lighthouse. The keeper remains a wisdom-dispenser without applying secondary pressure or status friction.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The researcher's backward-aging premise provides conceptual texture, but her interior life remains abstract—motivation and stakes are told through metaphor rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The student's fear is gestured at ("trembling hands") yet never pressures a micro-choice; he remains a passive vessel. Internal conflict is summarized ("truth required careful weaving") without simultaneous contradictory wants operating on the page, and the final exchange feels more like illustration than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and his perceptual signature (harmonic reading) is distinctive, but the arc lacks genuine internal contradiction—he arrives knowing his art and executes it with only mild weariness. The grandmother's teaching and his "last practitioner" status are told rather than embodied in a choice that forecloses a path. The final smile and turn toward work read as competent execution rather than a decision that costs him something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's motivation to climb rather than teleport and carry the worthless keystone establishes her character-specific resistance to automation. Her interiority is mostly concrete, though "sacred simplicity of human effort" edges toward abstraction. The grandmother's journal seeds the reflective passages, which anchor to the present climb and keystone handling. The final realization—that she'd been learning to see differently—reads as earned by the repeated attempts and the mist-walking failure, though the epiphany language ("never been underachieving") flirts with overstated clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's character is established through concrete action (lighting lamps, diving) and her grandfather's obsession provides backstory that tilts present choices. However, interiority remains sparse—her decision to dive and photograph the bottles lacks visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the moment. The final choice to "complete his luminous vow" is stated rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is minimal; we see action but not the layered, contradictory feelings driving it.

    Mira's motivation is coherent and her discovery arc tracks logically through the beats. However, her "quiet enthusiasm" remains largely asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Kael's shift from doubt to belief happens off-stage ("his doubt wavering") without dramatized resistance. The final transformation lacks visible cost—no one wrestles with fear, hesitation, or trade-off; they simply "wavelength align" in unison.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and her predecessor's voice emerges through the recordings with distinct texture. The choice to walk away from Daniel is motivated by her vision of the future, though the decision itself happens off-page in summary ("last week"). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her surge of joy and her disciplined refusal, embodied through the crystallized-memory image. Minor deduction for the peak choice occurring in backstory rather than present action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Emris is characterized through consistent micro-choices (spending savings, collecting dripped water) and embodied emotion (clutching the bell, hands moving steadily). His lukewarm magic and observational skills drive his approach with visible trade-offs. The "earnestly naive" and "brittle devotion" traits constrain choices throughout, though the final transformation from brittle to solid feels slightly under-earned given the smooth execution. Internal contradiction is present (devotion vs. despair) but could press harder in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is characterized primarily through his role ("thirty years as levee warden," "vigilant watch") and backstory fragments (schoolhouse, Sarah's kiss) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His decision to sit and listen is passive reception, not a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Eleanor is more vivid ("ninety if she was a day," camera in hand) but her motivation arrives fully formed rather than developing under pressure. The piece relies heavily on reflection and summary of past emotions rather than embodied present-tense contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and her journey to harmonize logic and intuition is traced through concrete actions (kneeling for the crystal, following starling patterns). The grandmother's handkerchief provides character texture, though the "secretly sentimental" trait is told more than tested under pressure. Internal contradiction is present (Academy's pure-science doctrine vs. her discovery) but her choices feel inevitable rather than genuinely difficult. The final synthesis lacks visible cost—she succeeds without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interior life is concrete and embodied—the parachute buckle, muscle memory, jaw tightening—grounding her resistance to Command's pressure. The contradiction between her need to please Ground and her commitment to truth creates genuine internal conflict that drives the climax. Minor issue: the predecessor's breakdown is summarized rather than felt through Vera's present fear, slightly weakening the stakes. The final choice to hold her ground feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (isolation, career risk).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira's emotional numbness is dramatized through concrete choices (reaching for the jar, proposing joint custody) rather than mere declaration, and her internal contradiction—needing the child not for love but to "vivify" herself—creates authentic tension. Clone-Kira's mirroring physicality and emotional excess provide clear contrast without caricature. The characterization satisfies most bullets, but the philosophical self-diagnosis ("I came back wrong," "You feel everything too intensely") edges into therapy-speak during peak beats, pulling slightly away from embodied discovery. The final handclasp and mutual acknowledgment feel earned by prior causality, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Martin's grief-driven ritual is embodied through concrete actions (conducting with the leaf blower, humming off-key) that reveal contradictory impulses—seeking connection while hiding from his wife's pain. The progression from solitary practice to shared ritual with Sarah is earned through accumulating pressure. Interior experience remains specific ("a loosening, a small breaking-through") without therapy-speak, and the final choice to return tomorrow forecloses isolation with visible cost. Sarah's arc is thinner but functional; her sudden laugh-cry feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris is rendered through specific contradictions—feral instinct versus aching intelligence, beast versus scholar—with embodied tension in her clawed hands digging frozen earth. Her choice to destroy the pendant is earned by the on-page stakes and her three-hundred-year guardianship, though the "make friends with uncertainty" motivation arrives as abstract summary rather than dramatized friction. The dimensional homesickness operates more as atmospheric label than lived constraint forcing micro-choices. Internal voice is consistent and specific, with no therapy-speak contaminating the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cassia's interiority is concrete and consistent—her seventeen years of failure drive choices and the final transformation arises from earned shift. Internal contradiction shows when she abandons validation of her father's legacy to embrace creative destruction. The "stoically sensitive fingers" moment embodies her perception, though some reflective blocks edge into summary rather than micro-choice. Emotion is mostly embodied ("tears freezing on her cheeks") but the epiphany leans close to statement ("hopelessness was just another ingredient").

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her shift from protocol-based listening to seeking silence feels earned through her seven years of repetitive work. The mentor's deathbed directive and her moment of recalibration ("discarding assumptions") show agency under pressure. However, the final epiphany arrives too smoothly—no visible struggle or trade-off when she finds the fragment, just immediate understanding. The closing insight about transformation feels asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mateo's motivation is clear and he acts decisively under pressure, but his interior life remains thin—we see competence and "resiliently positive energy" without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion that would deepen the stakes. The relationship with Torres is functional but lacks friction or status dynamics. The closure choice (holding the hourglass steady) feels more passive reception than a foregrounded trade-off with visible cost. Backstory (previous deckhand's gift) is economical and anchors present action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's profession as a fever dream architect creates a coherent lens for her perceptions, and her motivation to understand her shifting memories drives her choice to weave. However, her interior remains somewhat abstract—"unsettling calm" is invoked rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The climactic weaving sequence delivers insight through action, but the epiphanies arrive smoothly without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The final acceptance reads more like therapeutic resolution than a choice with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Carta's motivation to learn edge geometry is clear and drives her descent into the benthic city, but her internal conflict remains largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The chain link functions as a concrete anchor for her past, yet her emotional progression feels smooth and declarative—"understanding flickering at the periphery of her comprehension"—rather than embodied through sensory degradation or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment of tracing constellations reads as convergence rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Current-Through-Stones remains functional but secondary, applying pressure through pedagogy rather than opposing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistently rooted in her backstory ("she'd been one of those voices once"), and her professional calm under pressure reads as embodied competence. The piece shows micro-choices (adjusting equipment, making calls) that align with her protective stance. However, Lily's arrival feels more like a plot convenience than an earned character beat—her decision to come is told rather than dramatized, and the bruise functions as a visual cue without internal contradiction or struggle on the page. Internal conflict in Mira is minimal; she moves through the scene without meaningful friction between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to honor Kove is clear and drives her descent, but her internal experience remains largely declarative. The claustrophobia is named repeatedly ("compression in her chest," "clawed at her throat") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under that specific pressure. The promise to Kove's daughter and the institutional erasure provide stakes, but we never see Mara's agency tested by a trade-off that would foreclose a live path with visible cost—she completes her documentation as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied through the heartbeat-counting tic, which modulates with pressure. Her guilt and pursuit of understanding drive clear choices (spilling ink, running pattern recognition). However, the final epiphany—"Her error wasn't the calculation"—arrives too cleanly without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat; the realization feels more like a gift than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sarielle's motivation to preserve her language is clear and rooted in cultural loss, but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The copper veins function as marker rather than internal contradiction. The final walk-away reads as acceptance but lacks visible cost—her fingers are "worn smooth" yet this foreclosure carries more poetic assertion than embodied consequence. Interiority remains atmospheric rather than character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's trajectory from clinical detachment to openness carries embodied detail: "her clinical detachment crack like ice," the trembling hand at the phone. The climactic choice—pocketing the arrowhead and asking if the returned come back—shows contradictory impulses (career vs. cosmic possibility) acting simultaneously. Backstory regarding Voss anchors present decisions, but "bitterness began to metamorphose" tilts toward label-speak rather than showing internal friction through micro-choices. The final question forecloses the investigative path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear—to reawaken beauty through music—and her choice to continue playing despite the violin cracking shows commitment under pressure. However, her interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("existed in the gap between knowing and understanding") rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation moment feels externally observed (statues weeping, trees blooming) rather than earned through her internal struggle with visible cost. Her agency at closure is present but the psychological price of the broken violin and what she's risking personally remains under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her choices are consistent, but her interiority remains somewhat abstract—"fostering connections" and "already linking the next absences" read more like thematic declarations than embodied contradiction. The piece lacks a meaningful internal conflict or visible cost to her choices; she executes her plan without evident fear, doubt, or trade-off. Secondary character Samir appears briefly but applies no pressure. Backstory is extensive (~25% of the text) but remains primarily expository rather than anchoring present micro-choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carpenter's interior landscape is established through concrete action—holding brass, singing wordlessly, testing the crown—and his motivation to see possibility in silence is dramatized through persistent rebuilding choices. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("space where meaning could grow like plants from cracks") without embodied contradiction or stakes that force a visible cost. The character endures and persists but never faces a choice that forecloses a path; his work proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle or mistake. The final touch of the halo fragment repeats the opening gesture without demonstrable change in his stance or options.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cordelia's motivation is clear and her quirks (prime-number hours, hyperbolic mapping) are grounded in consistent worldview. Internal contradiction appears when she wrestles with theory yet remains distant as "documentarian," but the contradictory impulses don't act simultaneously in scene—her walk-and-whisper ritual unfolds without visible cost or refusal. The final smile observes rather than chooses, leaving no path foreclosed on the page. Backstory (grandmother's scarf) anchors concretely but occupies roughly 15% without altering a present micro-choice beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her obsession with the cipher shapes consistent choices across the piece. The final decision to step into light feels earned by her methodical pursuit, though the moment lacks contradictory impulses—she moves toward Theo without visible hesitation or cost to her librarian identity. Theo remains a cipher rather than a presence; his translucence at the end doesn't test Mara's commitment because he simply beckons. The watercolor palette's fingerprints and the brother's vanishing provide embodied anchors, but the peak choice reads more as inevitable surrender than a choice with genuine internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's arc from avoidance to acceptance is present but leans on label-only interiority: "punctual," "unassumingly bold," "ready." The sister's backstory is told rather than embodied, and Mara's transformation into locksmith arrives as announcement rather than earned stance crystallization. Internal conflict between fear and longing exists but remains abstract; micro-choices (unwinding the ribbon, walking seven steps) feel like puzzle-solving rather than character-specific renunciation with visible cost. The final "I'm ready" declaration replaces on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her hands-on folklorist nature shapes key choices (plucking the mushroom despite protocol). The vanishing-memory hook provides strong internal conflict. However, the final realization feels slightly over-articulated ("The fairy ring had held these memories separate from time's natural decay, but that separation came with a price") where embodied cost would land harder. The choice to gather mushrooms earns the shift, but the interiority occasionally edges toward explanatory rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's nervous backward-walking habit is established early and her motivation to "mentor resilience quietly" drives her interaction with Finn. Internal states rely heavily on metaphor ("defensive formations around a central void") rather than embodied contradiction. Finn's "combative tenderness" is told and illustrated but his micro-choices under pressure lack genuine cost—he softens predictably rather than choosing between competing goods. The archivist's final admission ("still nervous about being found") touches vulnerability but arrives as articulated insight rather than a dramatized forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clearly stated (preserving wonder) and her actions follow logically, but internal contradiction is absent—she proceeds smoothly through each step without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The climactic weaving sequence relies on poetic summary ("coaxed it, showed it") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. Her forty-year backstory and grandmother's teachings anchor her competence but flatten tension; we never see her genuinely tested or risking failure in a way that would reveal deeper character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her interiority is concrete ("fingers already anticipating the familiar weight"), but internal conflict is largely absent—she encounters no contradictory impulses during the work. The fisherman's transformation from shifting features to "solid now, his face clear" provides embodied emotion and a credible arc earned by the net's unraveling. Micro-choices (selecting the needle, beginning at the net's edge) reveal methodology but lack high-stakes tension or visible cost that would foreclose a path for Maren herself.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's interior work is concrete and embodied through her methodical cataloging, perceptive eye, and hands-on fresco examination. The protagonist's motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—drives choices with visible cost (leaving vault doors open, committing to step through the unknown), and her shift from preservation to active inquiry is earned. Minor weakness: internal contradiction could be sharper; her "shielded openness" is told more than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. No therapy-speak, and the final renunciation (opening doors, stepping into the gap) forecloses the path of sealed preservation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and specific, particularly her embodied relationship with death since childhood. The final choice to leave the snow globe carries visible cost—abandoning her collection impulse, her pattern of solving mysteries. Internal contradiction operates well: she seeks answers yet realizes finding doesn't equal understanding. Minor slip: the sister's drowning occasionally reads as explanatory scaffolding rather than live pressure on present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Moth's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and consistent, and the ghost provides a second focal point with legible emotional stakes. However, interiority remains abstract—"driftingly alert awareness" and "tinkersong wonder" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (painting the mural and receiving gratitude) feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page conflict between competing impulses. Moth's competence is never genuinely tested; no mistake compounds pressure before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's "warmly inquisitive nature" is told rather than shown constraining choices under pressure. Her decision at the elevator's halt arrives quickly without visible internal contradiction or cost—she simply chooses to learn the diary and descend. The captain's character is delivered entirely through summary and diary excerpts rather than dramatized memory that tests present stakes. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("strange, grateful affection," "careful servant's mask") instead of embodied sensation that degrades under the promotion decision's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied—her categorization project emerges from fifteen years of pilot reports and is tied to her grandfather's conviction. Internal contradiction appears when she reframes the broken tether as freedom rather than emergency, and her micro-choices (opening the journal, noting the "anticipation" in the lenticular cloud) reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance—understanding that "empty spaces weren't empty"—is earned by her observations throughout, though the embodied cost of this realization remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's condition (face blindness) is well-embodied through tactile perception and pattern-seeking behavior. Her interiority is specific and character-particular: "her eyes betrayed her" and "touch had become her true sight" ground the trait in consistent perception. The final choice—adding stars to the founder's eyes—feels earned as an acceptance of her limits rather than a solution, foreclosing the path of perfectionist completion with visible cost. Minor deduction: the discovery of limits feels more thematic declaration than contradictory impulse acting in scene; the protagonist's internal conflict remains largely cerebral rather than embodied in competing desires during the climactic brush strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Celeste's interiority is concrete and well-embodied; her curiosity drives micro-choices (tracing the phrasebook, noting coordinates, smudging the chalk) that show consistent character-particular motivation. The decision to hide the discovery and proceed cautiously at the end feels earned by the layered understanding of Mara's fate and the Guild's threat. Internal contradictions—fascination versus self-preservation—operate simultaneously in the final beats. Minor: the master Hendrik remains largely off-stage and contributes only background threat rather than on-page pressure, limiting relationship crucible work.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miren's professional expertise is embodied through tool handling and repair decisions. Her motivation—learning repair rhythm—is dramatized through the gear-selection sequence and the acceptance of imperfection at closure. Internal contradiction emerges in her choice of an irregular meteor gear, accepting "imperfect" over "perfect" with visible cost to world stability. The reflection on her grandmother and the broader meditation on beauty-in-fracture risks lengthening without adding new pressure, but micro-choices (heating the pick, filing the gear) keep interiority anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and sustained across the narrative: she orchestrates collective recovery through her chalk messages. Her interiority remains surface-level, though—"she wouldn't watch it happen again" asserts rather than embodies contradiction. The final exchange with Kessa lands cleanly but arrives without earned internal cost; Mara's choices feel mission-driven rather than conflicted. Embodiment is minimal; the ectoplasmic finger moment is vivid, but emotional states are mostly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's role as adjuster is established, and her seventeen-year burden with the puppet head provides history, but her interior life remains largely abstract. The motivation "to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse—"hands trembling" and "bruised awe" are the primary physical markers, while much of the interiority operates at a conceptual altitude ("mathematical poetry," "nested patterns") that distances us from immediate sensory pressure. The final choice to descend with the puppet head feels like acceptance rather than a turn that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's reluctant caretaker role is established early and her choices drive the rescue, but her interiority remains somewhat generic—phrases like "rough as grief" and "scrapes and bruised pride" feel stock rather than character-particular. The couple she rescues are purely functional and add no secondary pressure; they're props for her heroism rather than people with their own agency. Her final realization ("not a burden, but a gift") reads as a conventional epiphany rather than an earned shift with visible cost. The micro-choices (snatching the nut, reading shadows) show competence but little internal contradiction or struggle that would deepen her beyond the archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interior life is specific and embodied—the polymer chemistry lens filters her perception throughout, and her grief manifests in concrete withdrawal (sleeping in the lab, building longer chains). The choice to scatter ashes across five channels rather than one is earned by her realization about connection through divergence, showing contradictory impulses resolved through action. Minor slip: the chrysalis placement feels slightly convenient as a symbolic bookend rather than a fully motivated choice. The renunciation of isolation and commitment to reconnect carries visible cost (she must face the pain she's been avoiding).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical musings ("integrated fragmentation," "mindfully scattered") that read as thematic decoration rather than character-particular thought. The customer arrives with clear want but his internal contradiction never surfaces in scene—he accepts the bottled darkness without visible struggle or cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get "trembling hands" at the end but no sustained physical manifestation of his stakes during the transaction. The parole band "glimmers" repeatedly as a visual motif but never constraints a choice or reveals competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maron's interiority is consistently embodied through his synesthetic gift—tasting memories, feeling grief as frost—and his actions align with his chef's sensibility. The protagonist demonstrates contradictory impulses (fear of subsumption vs. compulsion to help) that act simultaneously during the pavilion scene. However, the final choice feels somewhat underearned; we see him successfully sandpaper memories without witnessing sufficient struggle or cost that would make his mastery credible. The shift from threatened subsumption to sturdy control happens too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear—she wants to reunite her community through recorded song—and her decisive action (taking the cuckoo weight) drives the climax. However, her interior life reads more as curatorial mission statement than embodied contradiction; she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible personal cost on the page. The farmers' turn from suspicion to singing feels abrupt, summarized rather than earned through resistance or misunderstanding. The ending gesture ("smiled, already planning") flattens what could be Charged Poise into tidy satisfaction without foreclosing a path or naming what she gave up.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The transformation from neural architect to "archeologist of abandoned dreams" arrives via exposition and stock epiphany language ("understood now," "deeper calling") rather than earned choice with visible cost. Interior voice relies heavily on abstract constructions and therapy-adjacent diction ("synaptic plasticity," "neural cross-contamination") that feel more like prompt echo than character-particular perception. The final act of "becoming a bridge" is told as metaphysical summary rather than shown through a concrete decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's "prism-minded" nature is asserted repeatedly but rarely embodied in concrete contradictory impulses or mistakes under pressure. Her agency at closure—touching the stone and "harvesting" combinations—reads more as passive reception than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interiority leans toward expository self-awareness ("she understood threshold effects") rather than embodied conflict, and the final paragraph's promise to plant seeds feels like thematic summary rather than a renunciation or alteration earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and sustained—seventeen years of devotion signals deep commitment—but her interior life remains somewhat flat. The piece tells us she is "symphonically minded since childhood" and driven by "quiet intensity," yet we see little embodied contradiction or struggle in her choices; she works methodically without visible internal friction. The final moment when birds arrive reads as external validation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Micro-choices (positioning insulators, adjusting tensions) advance craft but don't reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kavir's interiority is concrete and particular—the chess-tutoring backstory grounds his analytical approach, and the exile creates a plausible wound. His choice to return and then yield the council testimony to his former student feels earned by the prior causality. The daughter's ascent to heir apparent happens offstage, which weakens the relational crucible slightly, and Kavir's discovery of "unspoken suffering" risks abstraction in a few lines ("the emotional architecture" phrase), but the final renunciation carries visible cost and the worry stone anchors embodied habit throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlow's arc from cataloging silence to witnessing it is broadly coherent, but the pivotal choice—closing the diary again—arrives without visible internal conflict. The character's self-aware interiority ("I was too afraid to ask") operates at diagnostic distance rather than embodied pressure. The shift from lockpicking attempts to radio transmission feels more conceptual than emotionally contradictory, and the final renunciation lacks the felt cost of forgoing knowledge that seventeen years of effort promised.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interiority is well-developed with embodied contradictions—her ambition versus acceptance, her sensitivity as both gift and curse. The journey from driven herbalist to someone who understands endurance shows credible internal conflict. However, the transformation feels somewhat summary-driven in the final third; the key epiphany ("serenity within motion did not mean eliminating discomfort") arrives through reflection rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother's doodles and journal work consistently, but the final wisdom-sharing moment lacks the micro-choice tension that would elevate the change.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's choice to follow the water flows shows consistent character logic, and her final realization about resilience is earned through on-page observation. However, her internal landscape remains somewhat thin—she feels more like a vessel for wonder than a character with competing impulses. The moment when she "finally understood" arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized contradiction or cost. Embodied emotion is present but doesn't layer with genuine irrationality or self-deception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's investigation methodology is clear and her motivations anchor in her father's legacy, but her interior life remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The patch serves as emotional touchstone yet her decisions flow smoothly without embodied hesitation or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final realization about foresight feels stated rather than earned through on-page struggle with competing values. Competence dominates without meaningful friction between professional detachment and personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's synesthetic perception is vividly embodied ("tasted sound as copper," "words tasting of ash"), but her motivation to save the bells feels asserted rather than dramatized through prior stakes. The descent into the cavern tracks a single goal without meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her final choice—striking the ice column—resolves the Council conflict via proof rather than earned renunciation or personal cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior motivation is clear and rooted in fifteen years of perceived failure, though the arc relies heavily on reflection. The monastery constraints and her decision to step through the fold show agency with cost. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("potential, coiled and waiting") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice feels somewhat inevitable rather than torn, reducing the felt weight of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    The operator's borrowed personalities are described but rarely constrain on-page choices in dramatized beats. Interior states rely heavily on abstraction ("anxious precision of a clockmaker," "languid confidence of a river guide") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile is "someone else's," but no visible cost attends this dissolution beyond thematic assertion. Motivation remains conceptual—mapping emotional mathematics—without friction between competing wants that would force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's compulsion toward the pendant and his uncertainty after Venn's disappearance establish clear internal conflict. However, his transformation from hurried messenger to engaged participant happens too smoothly—the merchant encounter triggers immediate kneeling "despite his training" without embodied resistance or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shepherd and Keeper encounters reinforce the pattern but lack the friction of competing desires that would elevate the arc. Motivation remains consistent but the choices feel more inevitable than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her stake personal, but her interiority remains thin—she moves through the scene without contradictory impulses or embodied doubt. Hartley's admission "I fought you because I was afraid" lands cleanly, yet his turn from skeptic to believer pivots on a single external trigger (frost patterns) rather than dramatized internal contradiction. The final choice to photograph the frost feels inevitable but lacks visible cost; Elena's professional vulnerability is declared but not tested on the page. Micro-choices exist but emotional range stays narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mariko's motivation is embodied through the weaving work and the amber bead warming against her chest. Her decision to cross the threshold carries visible cost—she takes Kenji's place in the liminal space with full knowledge of the consequences. The interiority remains consistent and specific to her craft, though the grandmother's exposition in the middle third summarizes key backstory rather than letting Mariko's present choices reveal it fully. The final act earns the sacrifice through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's "quiet" characterization is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her plan and execution read competent without visible struggle or foreclosed paths—she succeeds linearly. The magician arrives on cue, the silk works, the trees respond; no meaningful mistake or cost emerges from her meekness or determination. The final choice to continue feels like continuation rather than a decision that forecloses an alternative with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's sensory gift is embodied through concrete perception (temperature gradients, vibrations, taste of air molecules) and drives her actions. Internal contradiction appears when she weighs infinite variations against retrieving her sister, showing genuine ambiguity. The final choice to delay demonstrates renunciation with felt cost ("tasted like goodbye"), though the decision itself remains off-page. Mira's presence is filtered through sensory signature rather than direct interaction, maintaining POV discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's progression from reticent observer to participant who shares her own truth is cleanly motivated by Marcus's collapse and the letters. The interior work is solid: her throat tightening at the letter, clutching the sea glass as talismanic reassurance, hands shaking when she writes. Minor slip: Marcus's dialogue "Can't let it go dark… Ships need… need to know they're safe" edges toward noble-keeper archetype without quite individualizing his voice beyond his written page. The choice to write and forward carries visible cost—exposing what she's protected—and her embodied hesitation earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is articulated ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but remains abstract; his interior life consists largely of philosophical musings rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in the present. The "accidentally prophetic" trait is told via anecdote (the fisherman, the newspaper clipping) but never dramatized as a micro-choice under pressure. His laughter and storm-calling feel like symbolic gestures rather than character-specific actions grounded in personal cost. The final act—adjusting the wick and steering light—lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path that would earn the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority carries embodied specificity ("hand returned to her chest," "breath caught"), and the borrowed-heart premise generates a coherent internal contradiction that drives her journey. Chen's observation about her "different shadow" feels more like a diagnostic label than dramatized perception, and his watchful stillness never forces a concrete choice on the page—he guides but does not oppose. The ending commitment ("stay… learn") reads as summary rather than a micro-choice with visible cost; we're told about future learning rather than watching her forfeit or risk something now. Backstory is well-anchored in the present via the heart motif, but the final beat would benefit from a specific renunciation or trade-off to earn the stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior motivation is clearly signaled ("what trees witness—what memories live in their rings") and drives her through the extraction work. The physical acts—pressing palm to bark, drawing crystallized dreams—ground her agency in embodied choices. However, the emotional journey remains largely observational; her transformation from curiosity to knowledge lacks internal contradiction or a visible cost that forecloses a prior path. The work proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle, limiting the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elora's motivation to rekindle the realm is consistent, but her seventeen-year arc compresses into summary rather than lived tension. The memory-keeping trait operates as atmospheric label more than dramatized contradiction—she "holds pieces without letting them consume her" but we never see that balance tested under pressure. The weaving climax shows competent execution without internal cost: no moment where her hand falters, no choice between competing goods. The faces at the window arrive as convenient chorus rather than pressure that forces a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iris's empathetic withdrawal is consistently motivated and embodied through concrete choices—crumpling the invitation, avoiding her sister's wedding. The sister wound carries visible cost and drives the library visit. However, the elderly woman's wisdom arrives too quickly without resistance, and Iris's shift from years of avoidance to "learning to stay by choosing when to go" lacks sufficient on-page friction. The final choice to return feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interior life is specific and embodied through her meticulous journals and grief over vanishings. The old woman's backstory about losing her archive grounds her transformation credibly. However, Mira's final shift from pure documentation to planting feels slightly rushed; the pivot occurs more through conversation than through on-page contradiction forcing the choice. The secondary character (the woman) applies clear pressure but the relationship itself doesn't evolve with visible cost—it remains tutorial.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and her actions align with her motivation to document fading promises. The discovery of the unwavering slide earns her small smile through prior causality—decades of meticulous work make this find meaningful. Internal contradiction is present (intimate with loss without being consumed) but could be more embodied in a peak choice. The tears moment reads genuine, though the transition to renewed purpose feels slightly expedient given the established solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nelle's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices under pressure feel earned—she closes her fingers around the fob, pulls out the recorder, walks away carrying "her father's silence like armor." Internal contradiction appears when she says she came "to capture the sound of trust breaking" but her real goal is blackmail-truce, a gap that enriches rather than confuses. Crenshaw remains functional but slightly thin; his repositioning and quiet capitulation feel more structural than psychologically embodied. The final renunciation forecloses the path of vendetta with visible cost (she walks away from full revenge), meeting the cost gate without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life shows specific contradictions—"luminous skeptic" manifests in concrete choices (walking away from observer position, pursuing weather-carriers)—and her relationship with Kael creates pressure. The taste-based perception system is consistent and character-particular. However, Kael's transformation ("for the first time in years, his storm clouds began to dissipate") arrives without visible struggle or cost; his shift from feeling cursed to accepting messenger status is declared rather than earned through on-page friction. The sibling dynamic lacks sufficient conflict to test their stances under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to honor her mother and release suppressed creativity is clear, and her charcoal-fingered hands serve as a consistent embodied detail. The internal conflict between clinical precision and emotional truth operates across the arc. However, the pivot from portfolio-carrying artist to cave-wall muralist feels under-motivated; the decision to draw transforms her instantly without visible struggle or cost in the moment. The mother's backstory carries thematic weight but remains largely told rather than pressing Elena's present choices until the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's physical response to dishonesty is established clearly and her motivation to seek the Archive is legible, but her interior life remains somewhat generic—"body recognized dishonesty before her mind did" is stock phrasing. The choice to take over the Archive at the end feels inevitable given setup but lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradiction in the moment; she accepts the role without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. The grandmother backstory works mechanically but doesn't charge the present choice with enough friction to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks to express what words cannot through tuned bells. Her sensory engagement with the bells is embodied ("chest tighten," feeling vibration through fingertips), and the decision to share her discovery by teaching others represents earned growth. However, interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene; the pilgrim interaction and final resolve feel more like thematic confirmation than friction-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    M4-RY's interior life is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—nostalgia corroding circuits, compulsive collection as penance, hands that tremble then steady. The photograph revelation and the choice to bury rather than incinerate show genuine internal conflict resolved through renunciation with visible cost. The android's motivation remains consistent and particular throughout, with micro-choices (reversing the laser polarity, opening the chest panel) that reveal character under pressure. Minor slip: the final steadying feels slightly neat given the depth of prior fracture, but the choice to tend rather than erase earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marissa's central belief that "listening heals" is stated rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her discovery of the locket and decision to investigate proceed smoothly without internal friction or visible cost. The courtyard gathering functions as backdrop rather than crucible—no relationship under pressure forces a choice that alters its state. Thomas and the neighbors remain functional placeholders who deliver information rather than apply immediate pressure through competing needs.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is asserted but not conflicted on the page—she moves through challenges without visible internal friction or meaningful choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The grandfather backstory is told rather than dramatized through present pressure. Competence overwhelms struggle: she decodes, encrypts, choreographs, and plans a jailbreak with no mistakes, miscalculations, or prices paid. The final act (seventeen prisoners freed) happens off-page via summary, foreclosing the chance to earn transformation through embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris's motivation is specific and embodied—her search for grandmother's memories drives clear on-page choices: descending to the chambers, scattering flowers, cutting into the heart. Interiority stays concrete ("facts of her grandmother...the living moments had been excised") and the final choice to enter the heart carries visible cost: her own deletion from the world above. Minor slip: the diviners' emotional stakes remain abstract, limiting their function as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The summoner's motivation is consistent and her solitary nature integral to the work, but she operates alone throughout with no on-page friction from relationships or secondary characters to test her stance under pressure. Interiority leans heavily into abstract craft terminology ("smoothed hush," "mapped silence") that risks becoming label-speak rather than embodied perception. The final choice to fold another wing suggests Earned Stasis, but the protagonist's competence is so complete—no genuine struggle, no mistake that compounds—that the cost feels more asserted than dramatized. Internal contradiction is minimal; she executes her plan without visible doubt or competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation is embodied through concrete action (the transparent sugar excuse, bringing the photograph) and her interiority shows genuine contradiction—she sought academic distance to "explain it away" while buildings "kept speaking louder every year." Mrs. Kovac's patient gesture vocabulary ("patiently nimble, like someone who'd spent decades conjugating irregular verbs") creates distinct characterization. The final choice to accept the seal feels earned by the grandmother backstory and Elena's weekly investment, though the arc relies heavily on told backstory rather than present tension between contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and specific—her choice to refuse the invitation arises from a clear history of loss and preservation instinct. The embodied work of archiving memories in flowers is particular, and her final renunciation feels earned by the sister's erasure and Mira's years-long practice. However, the sister remains abstract (a voice, a laugh, no contradictory impulses on the page), and Mira's internal conflict between recognition and control is articulated more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice lands cleanly with visible cost (foreclosing legitimacy, cementing isolation), but the path there is more reflective summary than scene-by-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's internal tension between conscience and law is rendered primarily through exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The Magistrate's motivations arrive largely through back-story explanation ("My predecessor commissioned this sanctuary...") rather than embodied present-scene contradiction. The "understanding bloomed cold" moment and key realization feel more like articulated epiphany than earned struggle. Internal conflict is summarized across three years rather than dramatized in this single night's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority leans heavily on philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation (discovering why some echo) is established but her choices feel contemplative rather than conflicted—she descends, listens, realizes, decides to teach. The sister's voice-in-shell revelation lands as exposition; the final choice to sing and return with others reads earnest but lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is clear and purposeful—her occupation as wreck-diver who "learned long ago that the drowned rarely lied" anchors motivation. However, the peak emotional beat (Katherine's anguish) relies on told effect ("anguish rippled," "frost spreading") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The final action (wrapping the globe, preparing to surface) reads as decision but lacks visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; the choice to drive to Halifax tomorrow is stated intent, not enacted sacrifice. Katherine as a ghost-character receives distinct voice and backstory but remains passive—no agency that alters Maya's tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kenji's interior world is vivid and character-specific, grounded in forty years of net-mending translated into philosophy. The apprentice girl's emotional arc from shame to intentionality is cleanly dramatized through concrete action. Minor slip: Kenji's insights occasionally veer toward articulate wisdom-dispensing that feels slightly over-calibrated for the moment, though his embodied work (whistling, whisk-turning, untangling) keeps him grounded. The final shift in the girl's approach is earned by on-page observation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her observational trait drives action, but her interior life remains somewhat flat—she moves through the investigation without meaningful internal contradiction or cost until the very end. The final choice to protect the coordinates shows character evolution, but the path there feels more procedural than psychologically fraught. Embodied emotion is minimal; her steadiness under pressure reads competent but lacks the visceral struggle that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's isolation and obsessive listening are established, but her transformation to "I choose the shadows" feels unmotivated—no prior friction between her scientific curiosity and darker allegiance is dramatized. The choice arrives because the prophet asks, not because competing values collide on the page. Interior contradiction is absent; she moves from lonely believer to shadow-shaper without visible cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart slam against her ribs" is the lone physical marker in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cosima's motivation is clear and shapes her choices throughout—trading poems for repair lessons, capturing sounds, and giving the music box to Mrs. Chen. The interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied details like "ink-stained fingers" and the visceral tears at the lullaby. The final gift to Mrs. Chen forecloses the path of keeping the box, a visible cost that shifts from isolation to connection. Minor slip: the poverty-to-purpose arc feels slightly predictable, and some internal states ("heart jingled with purpose") edge toward abstraction rather than full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Meris's engineer identity is consistently embodied through her technical vocabulary and problem-solving approach. Her motivation to protect the chamber is established, but the peak choice—retuning the key to her heartbeat—arrives without sufficient internal contradiction or visible cost; she moves through the climactic beat with competence but minimal struggle. The "logically committed, emotionally certain" framing in the final paragraphs reads as assertion rather than dramatized tension. Crane functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying pressure that forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ren's interior life is consistently rendered through sensory detail and her relationship to inherited duty. The motivation to expand traditional methods is clear, though the internal contradiction between rebellion and continuation could be sharper—her "restrained wildness" reads more as patient determination than genuine conflict. The choice to pursue moon mapping feels inevitable from page one rather than earned through dramatized pressure. Embodied emotion is present but tends toward contemplative distance rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's watchful calm and methodical investigation emerge clearly through micro-choices (photographing, uploading files, selecting encryption). Internal conflict surfaces when she weighs seven years of Reeves's influence against present evidence, and the choice to act carries visible cost—professional rupture and potential danger. Malcolm's posthumous characterization through his notes is effective, though his sister remains a telling-only detail. The backstory about Reeves's manipulation is economically anchored to present discoveries and tilts Elena's stance, meeting BRR requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eliana's motivational arc from swift judgment to deliberate restoration is grounded in concrete pressure (grandfather's letter, her loupe-focused craftsmanship). Marcus serves primarily as messenger rather than generating contradictory impulses of his own; his witness role is consistent but passive. The final choice to restore the heart is earned by prior setup, though the emotional epiphany ("She saw now what she'd missed") borders on summary rather than dramatized discovery. Embodied emotion appears in "trembling hands" and "something crack in her chest," but interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("haunted her through countless nights").

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mal's curiosity is consistently rendered through her tinkering and conceptual leaps, but her interiority leans abstract—"mechanical hope," "impossible longing"—without embodied contradiction or cost-bearing micro-choices under pressure. The mentor's dissolution and her cart-gliding background offer texture, yet the final launch feels more like an extension of her established pattern than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The yearning algorithm hums with "satisfaction," but Mal's emotional arc remains smooth, lacking the friction or renunciation that would earn the ending's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's investigative drive and eventual self-sacrifice show clear motivation, and the internal conflict between professional duty and cosmic pull is embodied. However, the protagonist's emotional progression from corporate archivist to willing transcendence candidate feels compressed; the phrase "she'd been brightly attentive since childhood" reads as label-only backstory without dramatized cost on the page. The final choice to "archive herself" lands with conceptual weight, but the speed of her conversion from skeptic to believer weakens the felt price of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior life is concrete and embodied—shadows "like oil on water," hands shaking from absorbed anger—but her final shift from absorbing darkness to helping families "see themselves in the breath before choice" arrives through a montage of mirror-visions rather than a dramatized struggle with contradictory impulses. The seven-year tenure and "courageous anomaly" status tell more than they show; we never witness her wrestling with burnout or doubt in scene. The families' hatred over Astrid is explained rather than felt through Maren's lived friction with their specific grief.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and embodied—"gripped reality loosely, like holding water" and the parasol's worn ivory tip ground her shift. Her choice to postpone the clinic consultation feels earned through three days of volunteering that demonstrate her need to understand rather than flee. The grandmother's parasol backstory risks exposition but pivots to present choice ("I thought it was about survival, but maybe it was about knowing when to let go"). Minor weakness: the final realization ("the change wasn't death calling, but life insisting") edges toward label-speak, though it's rooted in prior concrete listening.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation to reconcile with his understanding of failure shows interiority, and his invitation to Elena demonstrates purposeful choice. However, the final "learning to honor the space between them" veers toward therapeutic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The emotional progression relies on stated epiphany ("failure can be its own kind of destiny") rather than dramatized tension between competing impulses. Minor deduction for the tidy resolution that smooths over genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Senna's interior shows concrete motivation rooted in her training and the community's need, embodied through her peripheral-sensing technique and the ritual actions at the stone. The old man's "strangely honest" directness adds a credible voice contrast. The prophet remains off-page but her influence shapes Senna's choices with visible cost (kneeling, whispering the consecration, risking failure). Minor: interiority occasionally leans toward exposition ("The echo of the prophet's wisdom wasn't in her words...") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Margot is established through action (laying out photographs, greeting townspeople) with a distinct professional identity, but her interiority remains thin—we see her perceptive attention described rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses under pressure. The townspeople are sketched with clear grief markers (Maria's husband, Josef's pension) yet remain illustrative rather than individuated; their micro-choices (selecting photographs, drawing) feel prescribed by the facilitator rather than earned through visible internal conflict. The collective healing unfolds smoothly without friction or resistance that would reveal character limits or mistakes. No meaningful cost forecloses a path for Margot herself; she orchestrates and departs, her stance unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's reticence is established but her internal conflict reads thin—she fears speaking yet the fear never meaningfully complicates a choice on the page. The final resolve to "translate silence into understanding" is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her backstory about childhood whispering tells rather than anchoring a present micro-choice, and the crystal-warming moments remain observational rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prophet's interior world is concrete and embodied: his precognitive forgetting drives on-page micro-choices (kneeling to write, selecting what to document before it slips). The trait generates genuine internal contradiction—clinging to futures he will never inhabit—and the ending forecloses a path with felt cost (he will forget tomorrow, return confused, then lose the markers to tide). Embodied emotion is strong ("the accumulated silence… all the echoes that faded while you were still clinging"), though the character remains somewhat isolated; no relationship crucible tests the stance under interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kenji's interiority is concrete and his sensory training ("sound of a leaf falling") shapes his approach to the spinning hand. The micro-choice to follow rather than fight the mechanism is earned and embodied through his grandmother's teaching. Internal contradiction is present in his attempt to "capture moments before they fled" while accepting impermanence, though the arc leans philosophical. Chen remains functional but flat, serving as exposition conduit rather than pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is coherent and her micro-choices (selecting what to play, advising Mr. Chen to write about pancakes rather than apology) are purposeful. Mr. Chen's motivation—executing a flawless goodbye—reads authentic and his shift from surgical precision to vulnerability is earned. Rebecca remains largely offstage; her guardedness is told rather than embodied, and the reconciliation happens behind a summary veil ("their tone: tentative, then cracking, then flowing") that prevents us from testing her agency. The final choice lacks visible cost on the page; we're told reconciliation occurred but don't witness a trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her scholarly focus remains consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("understanding flooded through her") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The key moment of inserting the clockwork key and adjusting the orrery shows agency, but the path from discovery to solution feels more like puzzle-solving than character struggle with visible cost. No secondary character appears to test her choices, and the ending grants success without meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path—she simply completes the mechanism and "begins taking notes."

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marianne's arc from skeptic to forgiving believer is traced through embodied choices: picking up the tooth with shaking hands, cataloguing reasons this can't be real, then choosing "Teach me." Her medical training colors perception throughout ("examining fingers," "bone setting"). Internal contradiction appears when "the skeptic in her catalogued every reason this couldn't be real" while "the forgiver in her recognized that certainty had only ever been a comfortable prison"—both impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice forecloses her previous certainty with visible cost, though Iris remains somewhat thin as a secondary presence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's grief-driven transformation from astronomer to light-worker is traced through embodied choices (selecting abrasive compound, positioning glass precisely). Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between her archive-loss and her new teaching role, though the daughter's presence feels more thematic device than lived contradiction acting in scene. The children subplot introduces secondary pressure but their arrival is recounted rather than dramatized, weakening the relational crucible. Micro-choices around glass placement and tool selection show hierarchy of values, but the peak emotional beat—placing the final sea-foam piece—resolves too smoothly without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority shows some concrete detail (touching the amber pendant, kneeling by the icicle), but the characterization leans heavily on abstract labels: "watchful dreamer," "quietly proactive," "protected vulnerability." The confession backstory is told efficiently, yet Maya's present choices feel more like enacted metaphors than lived decisions under pressure. Dr. Chen's arrival and the notebook reveal provide external validation rather than forcing Maya to confront contradictory impulses in real time. The final invitation to see patterns reads as thematic closure but lacks the embodied cost or visible trade-off that would make the transformation unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The novelist's interiority is textured and consistent—"the shapes of others' hopes as directions, not destinations" carries specific philosophical weight. However, the central stakes remain abstract; her three-year struggle is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction. The figures from mist supply passive observation rather than active pressure that forces contradictory impulses into simultaneous collision. The final choice to "solemnize what was lost by carrying it forward" emerges more from accumulated meditation than from a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cassian's internal world is built through concrete sensory detail (green-stained fingers, grandmother's notebooks), but his motivation remains largely expository. The seven-year study and emotional stakes are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The weeping at the machine feels unearned because we never see him struggle with doubt or cost during the operation itself—the success arrives without visible resistance or trade-off that would validate the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera's patient methodology is clearly established through extended description of her pattern-making, but her actual choices are limited—she executes a plan we never see her doubt or modify. The core motivation (translating heartbeats into maps) remains abstract; we're told she "wanted to translate" but never see her wrestle with whether this will work, what she'll do if it fails, or what she's sacrificing beyond time. The final act of sealing the maps feels like completion of a predetermined ritual rather than a choice under pressure. Interiority consists largely of explaining her alchemical philosophy rather than embodied contradiction or stakes-driven decision.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's obsession with the timer is embodied through sustained tactile engagement ("fingers, trained to understand the secret anatomy of locks"), and his internal conflict between practical survival and wonder-preservation creates tension. However, the peak choice—calling the survivors to witness—lacks dramatized resistance or visible cost; he simply decides to share. The other survivors remain undifferentiated beyond "old Chen" and "the Martov twins," functioning as abstract backdrop rather than applying interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fractal weaver's core contradiction—"boundary-lessly trapped"—shows in her recursive gesture-work that spawns faster than comprehension, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation ("filter, collector, witness") rather than embodied pressure. The shift from "not trapped" to "becoming the trap itself" arrives as declarative insight rather than a choice forced by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The burdens' arrival and calcification provide external structure, but the protagonist's agency remains observational until the final departure, which feels like release from a concluded ritual rather than a forfeiture with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied emotion in her handling of the wood and tools. The widow's decision to carve emerges from accumulated reflection on Roland's journals and her understanding of his paralysis, showing internal contradiction between preservation and acceptance. The final choice—to create an imperfect bowl rather than a memorial—demonstrates agency with visible cost (abandoning perfection, accepting incompleteness). Minor deduction: the reflection density is high, but it anchors in present stimuli (wood, kettle, rain) and the micro-choices (testing the knife, beginning to cut) tilt present stance sufficiently under the BRR expanded allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is textured through collecting fragments and sensing erosion, but her internal contradiction—why she remains versus her stated desire to negotiate—lacks concrete embodied pressure in the middle beats. The ghost encounter at the end earns the final acceptance through prior causality, though the shift from "negotiate" to "accept" feels somewhat abstractly resolved rather than tested by a specific micro-choice under duress. Embodiment is present but sometimes dissolves into poetic register ("regret tasted like cloud-mist") that distances emotion. The camera wheel drop and hand-taking provide visible action, preventing full abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's interiority is concrete and job-specific—her engineer's eye traces water stains and drainage patterns with embodied attention. The final choice to send the proposal is earned by the night's escalating perception, and her pocketing the sextant piece carries visible cost (staking reputation on a likely-rejected vision). Minor slip: her supervisor's voice and the carnival's "melancholy romance" edge toward generic phrasing, and the shift from despair to optimism compresses slightly in the drafting sequence without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is concrete and grounded in embodied detail—shaking hands, unpacking the satchel, sketching as stabilization. Her fear and self-doubt drive credible choices across the arc. The epiphany moment ("making peace didn't mean forgetting. It meant acknowledging") edges toward thesis-statement clarity rather than lived discovery, and the final resolve to "apprentice herself… start again as a beginner at thirty-seven" lands a bit too tidy. Still, the contradiction between transcription skill and creative paralysis plays out in scene with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivations are clear and her expertise is established early, but interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musings rather than embodied contradiction. The passage "Logic was a tool that worked until it didn't. Intuition, sharpened by disappointment and refined by failure, had become her better compass" reads as label-speak that tells us her stance rather than showing it through micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance feels more like intellectual comprehension than a costly renunciation or transformation—she sits "with the serene upheaval of understanding" in a way that flattens rather than embodies internal conflict. No on-page cost forecloses a path; she simply gains knowledge and plans to document it tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to preserve ancient methods is established but remains largely observational. Her work with the rope is methodical and grounded in embodied detail ("fingers tracing," "coax the other knots open"), yet her characterization leans heavily on philosophical interiority—"revelation came only to those willing to wait"—that borders on essay-like summary. No meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulse emerges; she moves smoothly through discovery without struggle or cost. The final moment offers satisfaction but no visible foreclosure or renunciation that would demonstrate agency with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is vividly realized through concrete objects (the crimson thread) and her professional lens shapes perception consistently. The Duchess's grief is embodied in the unmarked palms and her projection language, though the arc from total absence to "slow work of...returning" feels compressed given no on-page reversal forces the shift. Internal contradiction appears (the Duchess weeps, releases "something long held") but the choice to "stop explaining" arrives via Maren's suggestion rather than dramatized pressure that changes the Duchess's stance through her own agency. The final gesture (hand squeeze) reads as a micro-turn, not a fully earned transformation scaled to seven years of absence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cael's motivation to restore beauty is clear and consistent, though his interior landscape leans toward philosophical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic decision to activate the incubator feels inevitable given his three-year investment, reducing dramatic tension at the peak choice. Vashira's mechanical/human duality is signaled but not explored through micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses. The protagonist's bedraggled state is mentioned but never constrains a tactical choice or complicates his physical capability during assembly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interior is anchored in embodied detail ("old shame rising and settling like the clouds overhead"), and her profession directly informs her perceptual priorities. However, her core motivation—proving that scars can sing—is declared rather than tested by competing impulses in scene; she moves through the lagoon sequence without visible internal contradiction or cost. Elena's transformation from rigid to softened reads too smoothly, lacking the friction that would make the grafting metaphor credible. The final choice (smiling acknowledgment) feels granted rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's characterization relies heavily on labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative mind") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Her skepticism is stated repeatedly but never genuinely tested—she accepts the impossible box mechanism without visible internal conflict or cost. The "defiant hush" gesture and her decision to press panels feel like externalized choreography rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "evolved skepticism" is asserted, not earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Keeper's motivation is established (sentimentalist moved by parental sacrifice) and embodied through action (materializing slowly, showing the gear). The mother's protective instinct drives her choice, though her shift from "it's a trick" to acceptance happens quickly without visible internal friction. The daughter remains observational without agency. Interior contradiction is present in the Keeper's "troubling serenity" but the mother's psychology flattens after initial resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carver's interiority is consistent and her motivation (understanding collective grief) drives the scene, but the transformation feels more told than earned through contradictory impulses. Marcus as spectral guide provides pressure, yet the protagonist's shift from treating grief as "isolated markers" to "collective memory" arrives through his exposition rather than her own struggle with competing needs. The embodied detail is solid (tracing letters, unrolling ribbon) but the peak choice—adding her own poem—feels like acceptance of instruction rather than a decision that forecloses a visible path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interior is consistently rendered through physical action—climbing with the rake handle, kneeling, carving—and her contradictory impulses (precision vs. silence, duty vs. guilt) act simultaneously across the piece. The seventeen-year maintenance ritual establishes embodied habit that the breaking-of brings cost. The final choice to release the pendulum is earned by the prior carving work and forecloses her silent stance with visible cost (carrying the truth forward). Minor: the brother's backstory is dense but anchored to present carving choices, keeping the reflective load functional.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marta's motivation is clear and her progression from chess defeat to decoding her grandmother's archive is causally sound. Her interior voice remains consistent—"blithe about death" is embodied through her humming and marigold-planting, and the shift to investigative focus feels earned. The grandmother remains an off-page presence whose choices are inferred, not dramatized, which limits relationship pressure. Minor deduction: the final paragraph's "understanding's cold light" edges toward label-speak, though it's quickly grounded in the concrete plan to visit seven graves.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her profession is conceptually interesting, but her interiority remains abstract throughout. The piece tells us she is "groundedly imaginative by necessity" rather than showing contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending offers no visible cost—she simply descends with pages "tucked safely," making the transformation feel declared rather than earned through forfeiture or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent—transcribing the broadcast to wake dormant stories in dust—but her interiority lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she touches the dust particles and "heard a voice...whispering a fragment" reads as straightforward discovery without internal conflict or cost. Her "smile" at the end and the declarative "she—diligent copyist, patient listener—had learned to read the language written in absence itself" tilts toward self-congratulatory summary rather than a difficult choice that forecloses a path. The decision to "distribute it sheet by sheet" is stated intent, not dramatized action with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority is grounded in concrete ritual and contradiction (cremating portraits, finding purpose in abandonment). The shift from scattering ash to understanding incomplete images shows embodied perception through the mask rather than abstract epiphany. However, the founder remains a device rather than a fully dimensional character, and Elena's final stance—continuing her work "differently now"—lacks a micro-choice with visible cost that forecloses a live option. The reflection-heavy design (roughly 40% retrospective material) anchors in present stimuli (mask, chair, garden) but applies modest pressure to Elena's present choices, pushing against BRR's ceiling without fully earning the expanded allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus's interior is concrete and well-embodied ("obsessively" turning the cog, the smile "for the first time in months"), and his choice to distribute the texts rather than hoard them shows contradictory impulses resolved with visible cost. Karin's agonizing over words and her "abrasive calm" cracking slightly are effective. Minor weakness: Marcus's philosophical stance is told more than tested under pressure until the final beat, and his shift from solitary preservation to networked action feels slightly abrupt despite setup.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mrs. Chen's interiority is established through her teaching history and the zither inheritance, but her emotional states remain largely told rather than embodied ("expectantly resigned" functions as a label). The gathered students are named with their prejudices but lack distinct behavioral markers or speech patterns; they exist primarily as types. The ending choice—placing the rosette back in the box—feels more symbolic than motivated by internal conflict, and no visible cost attaches to the teaching act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear and her gift creates character-specific perception (tasting fear in vegetables, desperation in grains). Internal conflict exists between her celebrated status and feeling hollow, driving the inciting choice. However, the transformation from planting to distributing lacks concrete struggle—weeks pass in summary, and no on-page mistake or genuine cost tests her commitment. The final scene with the girl feels like repetition rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's involuntary truthfulness is demonstrated consistently through her actions and speech, creating credible internal pressure when she realizes she "can't bury it in comfortable fiction." Chen's motivation—regret over removing generosity from his algorithm—is coherent and drives his choice to reveal the failure to someone who cannot lie. However, the final exchange feels slightly over-articulated ("purpose isn't efficiency—it's joy") where embodied contradiction under pressure would strengthen the peak moment. Minor: the toll keeper occupation remains ornamental, not constraining any choice on this tower.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("creeping normality" as therapeutic diagnosis, the archaeology of feeling). Her micro-choices—pocketing the orris root, arranging objects, touching the door frame—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The internal contradiction between wanting to fix hollow spaces and needing to simply witness them is dramatized through action. However, the final turn from "sanctifying through offerings" to "houses need witness" feels slightly expositional rather than fully earned through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interiority is concrete and her arc from anger through understanding to a choice that honors complexity is earned through the statue's layered revelations. The emotional progression is credible—she moves through reeling shock, trembling anger, and finally to a stance that welcomes nuance—with embodied markers (trembling hand, watching bubbles spiral) grounding each shift. The statue's consciousness is distinct and its "incisively kind" pressure shapes Marina's micro-choices throughout. Minor: the architect's horror and Marina's epiphany about "threading understanding" occasionally drift toward thesis-statement clarity rather than fully dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority shows contradiction—"grim optimist," balancing theoretical courage against implementation fear—and her micro-choices (stepping sideways, pressing send) emerge from that calculus. The mentor figure reads more as externalized conscience than pressure; his dialogue articulates the theme rather than dramatizing distinct wants. The final choice feels somewhat preordained by the dream-logic frame rather than forged under live resistance. Embodiment is present but light; the "cold stone" and the fall lack visceral specificity that would anchor emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is built through concrete sensory anchors (saffron paint, orchid perfume, moon-pressed glass) and her insomnia ritual frames embodied perception. However, the daydream visions—while vivid—remain episodic illustrations of the theme rather than contradictory impulses forcing a difficult choice under pressure. The final act of lying down among orchids reads as earned exhaustion rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The piece leans toward accumulative texture over character-driven decisional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celeste's interior voice is consistent and her museum-curator sensibility colors perception appropriately ("perpetually displaced—to carry your purpose like portable luggage"). Her motivations are clear but the final organizing-of-artisans move lacks embodied contradiction or internal cost; she shifts from solitary reflection to community leader without dramatized friction. The breadmaking custom provides concrete embodiment, but the decision to rally the grotto lacks a visible personal trade-off or foreclosed path. Minor issues: the candlemaker's widow appears only as a tool in the final sequence without prior setup, and the puppeteer's passivity is solved by Celeste's intervention rather than his own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is vivid and particular—her counter-clockwise clocks and obsessive reverse-engineering establish a consistent worldview. The final choice to step into the radiance feels earned by her months of isolation and her philosophy of reversible fate. However, the emotional progression remains abstract; we see declaration of "bleak exhilaration" more than embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing fears. The piece delivers strong conceptual motivation but lacks the embodied hesitation or visceral cost that would raise it into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Margot's photographic curse is introduced vividly but remains largely a label; it doesn't meaningfully constrain her choices or generate embodied contradictions under pressure. The decision to "unbosom herself" feels told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The advisor materializes and vanishes without applying genuine relationship pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("afraid of everything") but not shown acting simultaneously in scene; the final insight arrives as epiphany rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's role as leeward tide prophet is established with concrete interior and embodied action; her interpretive method through the copper-wire trees shows character-particular perception. Motivation is clear—transforming obstacles into instruments—and her decisive command to adjust ballast under pressure is earned. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward exposition ("This was her instrument, built over five years...") without immediate pressure, and the final moment lacks visible personal cost or contradiction; her success feels assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific—her obsessive measurement of the crack, her inability to accept the city's complacency. Her "quiet drive" manifests in consistent action (documenting spirals, measuring daily, blowing the whistle) rather than label-only assertion. The final choice to "crack their certainty with patient evidence" feels earned by her three-year accumulation of knowledge, though the renunciation of her isolation lacks a visible interpersonal cost that would elevate the stakes. Minor slip: "dread pooled in her chest like shadow-water" edges toward stock embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal life remains mostly declarative ("her historian's training guiding her words"). The conversation with Hawthorne feels more like a debate exercise than a crucible forcing contradictory impulses to act simultaneously. Her final stance—"emotionally rational understanding"—is told rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal cost. Hawthorne's sudden capitulation lacks the friction needed to earn Elena's victory.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's transformation from surveyor to "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is clearly motivated, and his ritual of placing notes shows consistent internal logic. The interiority carries distinct texture—"stoic sensitivity" manifests in how he absorbs "every notation of subsidence and structural failure...a small death." However, the emotional arc lacks genuine contradiction; his feelings about loss are presented as layered but never truly conflicting, and the discovery of the letters doesn't meaningfully test or alter his established stance. The final choice to research the letters feels like continuation rather than a stance that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's professional identity as a "logical page indexer" is established early and her meticulous approach drives her investigation, but her interior life remains somewhat generic—"pulse quickened with dappled resolve" uses stock phrasing rather than character-particular embodiment. The decision to catalog the underground press is earned by prior setup (two years tracing origins, the manifesto discovery), though the final commitment feels more declarative than conflicted. Micro-choices (pressing the stamp, navigating to Section K, cross-referencing volumes) advance the investigation, but no genuine internal contradiction or mistake complicates her path; she moves efficiently from clue to conclusion without blind spots or cost-bearing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei's motivation is clear and her grief-driven actions are embodied through the repetitive craft work. The forty-year backstory and Lin's shadow detachment provide grounding, though the emotional interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final return to polishing shows endurance with visible cost (her isolation, the 852 cranes remaining), but the choice to continue feels predetermined rather than tested by on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses—hunting impossible phenomena while mourning tangible loss. Her micro-choices (modifying sensors, adjusting thrusters) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in trauma. The geode functions as an embodied anchor for her obsession. However, the final beat lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; she continues searching with bleak exhilaration intact, which reads as Charged Poise but doesn't quite earn the renunciation or alteration the prior causality suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's "perpetually surprised expression" is presented as label-only trait without constraining on-page choices. Her decision to accept the mission reads smooth and inevitable rather than conflicted; no visible cost or foreclosed path appears. The pilgrim remains a cipher who delivers exposition without pressure or distinct motive. Interior texture relies on abstract longing ("frequency of belonging") rather than embodied contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's guilt and her chosen penance method are established early, with embodied emotion ("trembling fingers") and a concrete history. The flashback to Elias's case provides clear motivation. However, her interiority relies on therapeutic framing ("the weight of unspoken words," "the ritual of examining each piece") that flattens rather than complicates. The confrontation crystallizes her renunciation cleanly, but the path there leans heavily on reflection rather than on-page contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Katrin's interiority is present but remains surface-level; her motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The grandmother's advice and seventeen prior exchanges provide backstory weight, but we never see Katrin struggle with doubt or cost in this moment—she operates with serene competence throughout. The prisoners are props with no interior life; the commanders exist only to voice distrust and nod. Emotional embodiment is thin: "Katrin finally exhaled" tells relief rather than showing physiological specificity under sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's contradictory impulses—wanting to guide again while fearing further failure—operate simultaneously in the launch scene when she both dismisses Amy and begins calculating the weather window. The progression from counting utility poles (a broken navigator's crude substitute) to "I'll use everything" earns the shift through prior causality. Minor slip: Amy's recognition of Marina's need feels slightly ahead of what the scene dramatizes, though the core motivation remains coherent. The final choice forecloses Marina's three-year retreat with visible cost (accepting vulnerability) scaled appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear—seeking answers about his past to avoid repeating it—but his internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene; he moves from seeking to understanding in a neat progression. The Interpreter remains a wisdom-dispenser without her own pressure or contradictory impulses. The final choice ("I choose to try") feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclosed other paths with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin; Marcus "stares," "nods slowly," but we don't see contradictory impulses colliding in his body or perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to save her brother is clear and urgent, and her transformation carries visible cost—surrendering humanity. Internal contradiction appears in the fear/love tension ("I'm scared" balanced against resolution). However, the metamorphosis itself is told more than embodied; we get constellation-fur and hollowed bones but little moment-by-moment sensation of what it costs her psychologically beyond a single admission of fear. The final state feels declared rather than inhabited, limiting the felt weight of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cartomancer's interior life is vivid and embodied—trembling fingers, gasps, burned throat—and her internal contradiction (stealing time while seeking repentance) drives the arc. The pivot from card-reader to present mother is earned by the glade revelation and the cloth-tracing ritual. However, the phrase "willingly perplexed" reads as a prompt label rather than dramatized uncertainty, and the epiphany about "ghosts of connection" tilts slightly toward articulated insight rather than pure discovery. Micro-choices (checking her phone in the hospital vision, repeated hand-tracing) anchor the change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's motivation to "complete the work" drives the piece, and her mass-change trait embodies emotion concretely. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("emotion too complex to name") and her epiphany about humanity's shadow lacks contradiction or genuine struggle—she simply believes and acts. Akio's pivot from "persistent critic" to hand-holding ally feels unmotivated; his disapproval dampens her spirits but doesn't create sustained friction or force a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her progression from wealthy to "orchestrator of small miracles" is clear, but the transformation feels more told than earned through on-page struggle. The young surveyor encounter reads as illustration rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; her stance remains consistent throughout without genuine friction between competing impulses. The epiphany about transformation's texture ("gradual, granular, like black sand") arrives as assertion rather than dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority shows purpose-driven detail (seven years of reading body language, tactical delays) and her transformation from sentinel to revolutionary is coherent. However, much of her motivation is told rather than tested on the page—she moves through the workshop with practiced ease but faces no meaningful internal conflict or cost in the present scene. The "smallest smile in the darkness" closes without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and Voss's ease ("His tension eased") arrives without friction. The revolution is declared complete before we see Maren struggle with a single trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Korin's precognitive curse provides internal contradiction (seeing "futures that might never arrive and pasts that hadn't yet occurred"), and her grandmother's death creates a coherent wound that drives the rock arrangement. However, the character remains largely contemplative rather than conflicted—her trembling hands at stone fifteen are the sole embodied resistance, and the final "understanding" arrives as insight rather than through a difficult choice that forecloses a path. The piece needed one moment where the curse or the promise forced Korin to sacrifice a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara's interior is concrete and charged with contradictory impulses—both angry and still, silenced yet screaming. Her ritual with the timer and the deliberate discipline of twenty-minute intervals embody her resistance without therapy-speak. However, her motivations and choices trend toward witness and documentation rather than decisions that narrow options; she observes and endures more than she acts under fresh pressure. The final choice to keep writing feels inevitable from the opening rather than a path foreclosed by fresh cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Adelaine's mechanical arm and academic ferocity show clear character signature, but her internal contradiction remains shallow—she's fierce yet patient, but these don't collide under pressure. The duel setup promises a values clash, yet both characters pivot too smoothly into collaboration without dramatized cost to pride or conviction. Harwick's fury dissolves into interest without embodied resistance, flattening what could have been a earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's shifting personalities create credible internal contradiction—September's "angular" clarity versus August's weeping silence. The molting trait shapes micro-choices: retrieving the tin, reading impromptu poetry, each filtered through the month's lens. The closure choice to plant "everywhere they tried to kill beauty" feels earned by the accumulation of selves and prior volunteer work, though the cost of October's forgetting is asserted more than dramatized on the page. Kai's arc from inmate to returned volunteer is cleanly motivated, and the relationship pressure is present but light.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pianist's core motivation and internal state are established clearly through embodied detail (winding the useless key, memorizing departures). However, the husband's return feels insufficiently earned by prior characterization—his sudden appearance bypasses the psychological preparation needed for such reunion. The protagonist's decisive creative act (splicing the film) reads as motivated but the emotional payoff lacks contradiction or visible cost beyond the surface longing. Minor: "strategically creative" appears as a label rather than emerging from demonstrated traits under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kima's interior conflict between skepticism and belief is embodied through concrete choices (holding the seed, recording dreams, kneeling to plant). The sister Prem functions primarily as a sounding board but applies immediate pressure through the monsoon deadline. Kima's final pivot from "certain knowledge" to "luminous doubt" is earned by the dream sequence, though the dreams themselves arrive as summary rather than dramatized pressure. Minor slip: the phrase "empirically whimsical method" reads as meta-commentary rather than character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life remains coherent throughout, moving from grief-curiosity to understanding through concrete anchors (box, compass, lace). Her choices track logically, but the final "understanding" arrives through exposition rather than embodied contradiction—Takeo articulates what she feels, reducing the cost of her realization. The renunciation or acceptance of inherited silence reads as told insight ("Mira understood") rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Takeo's slow speech and ritualistic precision are established but never constrain a choice or create friction.

    Helena's characterization is deeply embodied, with consistent traits like preprocessing reality shown through specific actions (spreadsheets, cataloging). Her internal conflict between analysis and presence drives micro-choices under pressure, and her final endurance to rebuild is earned with visible cost in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera's characterization is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing patterns and confronting Galloway. Her adaptability drives key decisions, and the final choice to create from fury is earned by prior causality. The cost is visible in the binding of Galloway and her return to the kiln, fulfilling the quick test.

    Mara's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as striking the tuning fork to feel vibrations, revealing her hierarchy of values. Her motivation to find new expression after trauma is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices like the public installation. The final renunciation of her old life as a vocalist is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the thermal maps of grief and hope. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her simultaneous grief and hope flickering in the heat patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marcel's motivation is clear and rooted in his professional identity, compelling higher-stakes choices with embodied emotion; his final decision to revitalize the library is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict remains somewhat subdued.

    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final decision to declare herself is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses between anonymity and connection, with visible cost in risking the former for community continuity.

    Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in her past-life memory, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final realization and release of the jade tear are earned through prior causality, showing a decisive change with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as panic and love during the breathing exercise, fulfilling the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and rooted in her retrocognitive condition, driving key choices like pressing the halo fragment. Her final acceptance of her recursive existence is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the disintegration of her photographs. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though minor diagnostic language ("retrocognitively trapped") is dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in resilience and strategy. Interiority is concrete, e.g., "worked with the calm of someone who understood," and her final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotions are embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—destroying the crystal—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Interior contradiction is shown in her realization that some sounds aren't meant to be preserved, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown in her reaction to the moonbeams. The final choice to become a painter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in abandoning her thief identity. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her trembling hands and realization, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing contradictory impulses; his final decision to reach out is earned by prior causality with visible cost in abandoning old pain.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maya's motivations are clear and rooted in her past betrayal and phobias, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to expose the truth is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost. However, the phobias are mentioned but not deeply explored in on-page action during the climax, slightly limiting interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The oracle's obsession with endings is concretely embodied and drives her choices, such as retelling through silence, with the final map-drawing earned by prior causality. The commander's marbled relief and doubt show contradictory impulses under pressure. Minor weakness: secondary character depth is functional but not deeply explored, though it doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    J-7's motivation to find the origin of thoughts is consistently dramatized through his actions and the time loops, with interiority shown via embodied emotion and micro-choices. His final realization is earned by prior causality, and his composure under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's characterization is deeply embodied through specific actions like her trembling hand and quickened pulse, with her decision to respond earned by the accumulation of doodles and overheard conversation; Dmitri's fear and desire are vividly portrayed through dialogue and symbols, creating a credible emotional arc.

    Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his negative luck score, driving his quest for answers. The vine dresser's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in her polishing and storytelling. Her final stance—proving the garden knows her—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the garden's behavior. Contradictory impulses are less prominent, but micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority shown through precise actions. The final demonstration feels earned by prior causality, though minor lack of contradictory impulses keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)

The final choice to "try" is earned by prior causality, rooted in his guilt and the Interpreter's guidance, with visible cost in his renunciation of the past. However, slight diagnostic phrasing in peak beats ("understanding settling over him") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict between fear and desire driving her reluctant metamorphosis. Emotions are embodied, such as her voice layering with "harmonics that belonged to creatures with too many throats," and the final choice to transform is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., interpreting Voss's body language) revealing her values. However, interior contradiction is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep internal conflict, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Korin's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her precognitive curse and the grandmother's promise create credible internal conflict, and the final understanding of letting go is earned with visible cost. However, interior contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictions like "angry and still" acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Helena’s blend of hyper-analytic coping and genuine, embodied grief is specific and consistent (“When their marriage ended, she'd made spreadsheets”), and her micro-choices—salvaging scales, building a taxonomy out of ruin—align cleanly with that trait. The arc from seeking de-dramatized beauty to accepting loss and quiet transformation feels earned, with visible cost in the wrecked greenhouse and dead butterflies. Internal conflict (analysis vs presence) is present but subtle rather than dramatized as a sharp in-scene clash, keeping this just shy of the highest band. The humility at the end reads as a credible deepening rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera is specific, grounded in her craft, and her investigative and moral choices clearly grow from her identity as a glass artist who values patience and transformation. Her interiority is mostly shown through perception of stone, frost, and light, which feels character-particular rather than generic. The internal conflict between self-preservation and confronting Galloway is implicit but could be sharpened on the page—she never seriously wavers. Galloway reads more as a functional mouthpiece for “revolution” than as a fully realized counter-presence, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s trauma, muteness, and sensory loss are rendered with concrete, character-specific detail (the “endless internal roar,” the way she feels vibration through bone). Her motivation to find a new language of music is clear and consistent, and her collaboration with Chen tracks plausibly from private refuge to public installation. The arc from shattered vocalist to someone who accepts a new mode of expression feels earned, though we get little in-scene contradiction or live inner conflict beyond grief vs. emerging hope. Chen is functional but lightly sketched, operating more as catalyst than fully pressured counterpart.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcel is specific and credible—a weary craftsman who reframes his profession through the haunting, with clear, consistent motives driving his choices. However, his emotional life is mostly conceptualized (“understood his profession's true purpose”) rather than embodied, and he encounters little internal resistance to abandoning his old life. The drowned scholars are sketched with one strong trait (devotion) but remain largely thematic figures. The final change—accepting his role as undertaker of the liminal dead—lands, but with relatively low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation and values are clear and consistent, and her choices (midnight runs, then public declaration) are well grounded in her history and sense of responsibility. Interiority is specific (the tactile relation to the bell, memories of her grandmother) and her restraint around money sources feels character-particular. However, her internal conflict around choosing to step out of anonymity is mostly summarized rather than deeply embodied in-scene, and her flaws or blind spots are only lightly implied. The young woman at the end works more as a thematic device than as a fully pressuring character.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei’s motivation—locating “where unused love is stored”—is clear, specific, and consistently driving her choices, from seeking the pilgrim to offering up Kwan Yin’s tear. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, especially in the drowning flashback and the breath-stutter that triggers the vision. The pilgrim is more archetype than fully individuated person, but he functions well as a pressure-bearing counterpart rather than needing deeper psychology at this length. The final renunciation (leaving the pendant) feels earned, though the emotional shift from raw grief to acceptance is a touch compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s motivation and interior logic are clear and specific: a lifelong compulsion to understand the “texture of time” that makes her interaction with the fragment feel inevitable. Her retrocognitive condition, professional history, and habits (the photographs, daily bridge walks) all cohere into a distinct psyche rather than a type. What’s missing at this echelon is sharper on-page contradiction under pressure—she transitions from fear/instability to acceptance with little dramatized resistance. The final acceptance costs her the photographs but doesn’t fully register as a painful sacrifice in her body or behavior, which blunts the arc’s emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—protecting diversity and exposing the regime drives every choice. Her competence and calm under pressure feel earned by the setup of long planning. However, she borders on idealized; we see little contradiction, fear, or genuine wobble under stress, which flattens potential complexity. The closing decision to bind herself to the land rather than flee further reads as credible but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s motivation is precise, personal, and drives every beat, from the obsessive cataloguing of “absences” to the final decision to destroy the crystal. Her interiority is specific and embodied (e.g., “Tears froze on Mira’s cheeks”), with a believable contradiction between her scientific control and emotional desperation. The relationship with the daughter is entirely off-page yet feels consequential and complex rather than schematic. The final renunciation (letting the crystal fall) is fully earned by the prior fixation on preserving the sound.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s motives and inner logic are clear and particular—the compulsion to steal portraits to “press [her] ear against destiny’s door” is strong and specific. Her shift from thief to would-be creator is thematically earned but emotionally low-friction; there’s little felt cost beyond a conceptual reorientation. Interiority is vivid but leans a bit declarative (“I need to reinterpret what I've been doing”), skimming over live contradiction in the moment. Celeste functions more as an articulate guide than as a pressure source, so the relationship doesn’t fully become a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus is rendered with rich, specific interiority—the narration habit, attachment to objects, and cautious emotional processing feel psychologically particular. His micro-choices (continuing to narrate, pausing at the bookmark, finally pocketing it and deciding to visit his sister) all align with a coherent value system. There is a credible internal contradiction between his desire for understanding and his fear of rupture. The only slight limitation is that the final decision lands a bit neatly, with relatively little visible resistance at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya is sharply drawn: the stunt-double past, claustrophobia, and recent identity shattering all inform her present choices, especially her stance toward Reeves and Emma. The internal contradiction between fear and resolve is credible (“her hand trembled... but she'd learned... vulnerability wasn't weakness”). Reeves, though only a voice on the phone, has clear, conflicted motives that complicate a simple villain role. The final decision to expose both the consortium and Reeves is well-earned by her history of being used and her evolving value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Oracle and commander are cleanly sketched with distinct roles and needs, and her fixation on endings coherently drives her behavior. However, interior contradiction and on-page emotional conflict are kept at a distance; we rarely feel her or the commander wrestle with competing impulses in the moment. The relationship dynamic—his doubt, her calm authority—works but doesn’t significantly evolve beyond initial positions. The final beat gives her an elegant exit but not a costly, character-redefining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    J-7’s curiosity about the origin of thought is clear, persistent, and convincingly rooted in his long history of maintenance reports, giving him a strong specific drive. His behavior—methodical sweeping, cautious but determined engagement with the violin—aligns with his “janitor” identity and functions as character, not just job. Internal conflict is present but light: he’s more steadily curious than genuinely torn, so we never see a truly pressured, contradictory impulse on the page. Dr. Yemeni is efficiently sketched as a foil and pressure source, but her inner stakes are underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and textured: her history of “unwanted knowledge,” her habits with the lost-and-found, and her interpretive use of the lens all feel plausibly rooted in who she is. Her internal shift from passive listener to active participant is motivated and tracks cleanly. Dmitri remains thinner, but his presence through doodles and overheard dialogue is enough for this length. The ending edges toward wishful neatness—his immediate reciprocation dulls some potential complexity in their flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The vine dresser is sharply etched—her ritual with the marbles, the notebooks, and her relationship to the maze build a coherent, idiosyncratic psyche with a credible history of gaslighting and reclamation. Marcus is thinner but still legible: his negative luck score and search for an alternative metric of worth motivate his presence and perception. Emotional conflict is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied, but her endurance and quiet defiance feel earned. The final contrast—her serene mastery vs his unsettled observation—lands as a believable character dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael reads as a specific, competent person with a clear want (to prove their temporal theory and be taken seriously) and a grounded role as the “obliging mechanic.” Their relationship with Venn has a subtle status dynamic—Venn as the established scientist, Kael as under-credited labor—but it never fully comes under pressure. Emotions are mostly implied through action and sensory focus rather than deeply dramatized internal conflict. The final shift (this discovery “is theirs”) feels earned but carries little visible cost or contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marta’s motivation to decode the ghost’s message and advocate for her is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (which notes to play, photographing the evidence, deciding to “tell them”) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and tied to her musician’s sensibility rather than generic labels. However, she’s a bit too tidy: there’s limited contradictory impulse or felt risk (no fear of being disbelieved, no real hesitation), which flattens potential internal conflict. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s guilt, competence, and belated insight are cleanly motivated and drive every choice; her line “I programmed it to be confident” crystallizes her flaw and responsibility. The embodied touches (post-fever heaviness, visual fixation on frost) keep emotion grounded. Internal conflict—duty vs. shame vs. determination—is present but could be sharpened by one harder, risk-laden choice rather than an unopposed resolve to fix the system. Chen functions mainly as a foil/support, with little independent pressure, which limits relational tension.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s motivation and method are clear and particular—his belief that “desperate people revealed patterns the religiously skeptical could decode” is strong—and his actions (descending, turning valves, documenting) align. However, his internal conflict is muted; we rarely see genuine hesitation, fear, or contradiction under pressure, so the final “I found what I came for” lands a bit too tidy and low-cost for elite-level depth.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—shifting from preservation to nonjudgmental witnessing—is clear, coherent, and well-grounded in specific experiences (“Words dissolved into mulch. History composted itself.”). Her internal stance meaningfully changes from control to loosened grip, and that renunciation carries a conceptual cost (accepting her own dissolution into the archive). However, active internal contradiction is muted; she’s mostly serene rather than torn, so we rarely see competing impulses within a single moment. The arc lands, but a touch more friction or self-doubt in scene would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara is rendered with clear, specific interiority—her doubt, professional composure, and maternal history braid into a coherent motivation, and her choice to underreact to Thomas’s breakthrough feels deeply earned. Thomas is more lightly drawn but still distinct in posture and small shifts (shoulders softening, humming, metaphor about starlight). Emotional responses are mostly embodied rather than labeled, though a few moments brush close to gentle sentimentality. The final return to the keepsake grounds her arc in a credible, quiet reconfiguration rather than a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miren’s vocation, tactile sensitivity, and quiet devotion are clear and particular, and her actions (probing the diaries, recognizing the tapestry, mounting it) all track cleanly with that core motivation. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or real dilemma; we don’t see competing impulses or values pressing on her. Catherine has a poignant sketch via the diaries but remains largely emblematic. The closing stance—her work is worth doing—is earned but comes without much visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s vocation, competence, and inherited ethics are sharply drawn, and her motivation to use espionage for “something resembling grace” feels specific and earned. However, the piece largely skips dramatized internal contradiction in the present tense—she never seriously wavers or reveals conflicting impulses under this new pressure. Emotional texture is more told (via backstory) than enacted in live dilemma. The result is a compelling but relatively untested inner life.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Calloway’s motivation and method are clear and particular, and his actions consistently express his theology, but he lacks on-page doubt or internal contradiction, which flattens the emotional arc. Marcus is mostly an object of concern rather than a character with legible stakes from his own perspective. The final “cost” for Calloway reads minimal—he succeeds without visible risk or compromise. Strong specificity of vocation and worldview helps keep this above-average despite the limited inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific, grounded in concrete history (grandfather, telescope, nautilus) and her professional life, and her dissatisfaction is well-motivated. The shift from hollow prediction to translation feels earned through the memory-mapping method and the mirrored horizon moment. Contradictory impulses (weariness vs compulsion to climb before dawn, nostalgia vs present numbness) are present if understated. The main limitation is how smoothly the final purpose-click lands; there’s little on-page resistance or cost as she pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and specific—her relationship to gravity, retracing, and fear-driven branching all feel psychologically grounded. The central turn (“The procedural generation wasn't random… built from her own cowardice”) earns her later, harder choices. Flaw: the realization of cowardice is told in fairly abstract terms rather than dramatized through an on-page, resisted choice before she embraces it. Still, the progression from scattered to singular self reads earned and costs her the comfort of avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Oskar’s motivation and history are specific and compelling, and his choices (keeping the needle, pursuing the backward recordings, building a method with Marie) all track cleanly from his numbness and deafness. His interiority is sometimes summarized in abstract terms (“emotional numbness… like sediment”) rather than dramatized through more contradictory impulses in scene, which slightly flattens complexity. The relationship with Marie is sketched but functional: her line “I can't feel anything when I play anymore” nicely mirrors his own conflict but doesn’t itself come under much pressure. The final shift to “quiet certainty” is believable but arrives a bit tidily, with limited on-page struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marianne’s characterization is specific and convincing—her pattern-obsessed meteorologist mind and social solitude are dramatized through habits, perceptions, and choices rather than labels. Her curiosity and integrity clearly motivate her staying in the courtyard, engaging the stranger, and taking up the satchel. Internal conflict is present but quiet: wariness versus the pull of the mystery and the validation of her work, though a sharper moment of hesitation or fear would deepen it. The older woman is a bit role-like and idealized in how neatly she names Marianne’s virtues, but she still functions as a credible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s grief, professional background, and attachment to the vial all cohere into a clear, specific interior life, and her micro-choices (coming to the greenhouse, uncorking the vial, allowing herself to watch) feel motivated and in character. The interplay between her work with light and her loss of smell personalizes the world’s catastrophe. Internal conflict is present but relatively gentle—she yields to the experiment quickly, with limited on-page resistance or contradiction. The emotional turn at the end feels earned, though it leans more toward a single breakthrough than a layered, messy struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is clearly motivated—his commitment to wandering and “bearing witness” is concrete and consistent, and his attention to the rope reveals a specific, believable sensibility. Interiority is rich and character-particular, especially in how he reads physical wear as narrative. The main weakness is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or internal struggle; he rarely feels genuinely torn. Sarah, while vivid in her brief appearance, functions more as emissary/idea than as a fully embodied person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s motives and inner life are clear, specific, and consistent—especially her decision to replace the bonfire with music and her re-interpretation of Sora’s “unfinished” ethos mid-performance. Her acoustic sensitivity is dramatized rather than merely asserted, and her emotional state is embodied through how she reads the greenhouse’s responses. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (grief and resignation vs. a stubborn, almost defiant tenderness), fitting the quiet scale. The family members are sketched economically yet distinctly enough to feel like a real, grieving group without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation and internal contradiction are sharply drawn: a professional cynic who genuinely cares about the gap between what people feel and what they need. Her shift from selling comforting lies to crafting a more honest “wish to forgive” is well-earned by prior interiority. Emotions are embodied through her tactile relationship with the amber and the static, not just labels. The cost of her choice—forgoing the simpler, cleaner lie—is present but somewhat understated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marianne and Chen are distinct, with clear motives tied to work, curiosity, and recognition of invisible labor, and Marianne’s shift in what she values feels organically earned from her choices. However, internal conflict is mild—her “shrewdness” never comes under serious pressure, and there’s little sense of risk in her involvement. Emotional states are more described than embodied under strain. The relationship is warm and believable but never truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s longing and social self-exile are clearly motivated and dramatized in her physical positioning at the edge of gatherings and in her secretive art-making. Her competence with marsh-reed weaving is used well to reveal character under pressure when she chooses to reveal the sculpture. Internal conflict (fear of intrusion vs desire for belonging) is present but could be sharpened; she moves from reticence to revelation with relatively little on-page resistance. Secondary characters are lightly but effectively sketched as specific people rather than props, especially Siora.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera’s curiosity, professionalism, and almost reverent relationship to time are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (borrowing minutes, then choosing to release them) track with that identity. However, she experiences little genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure—she is competent, controlled, and never truly torn. Emotional embodiment is present but relatively light and generalized, so the ending feels more like conceptual satisfaction than a costly personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s grief, intellectual rigor, and conjuring practice interlock into a coherent, particular psyche, and her final stance-shift from “find him” to “accept unsolvable systems” feels earned. Motivation is clear and consistent throughout, and micro-choices like not calling out to the possible brother reveal a believable hierarchy of values. The internal conflict between rational proof and emotional need is present but could surface more viscerally in-moment rather than mostly via stated concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam is specific, grounded, and her caretaking temperament comes through in concrete behavior (careful handling, multiple trips, no need for credit). Her core motivation—to “understand how to matter”—is lucid and coherently expressed in her choices. What’s missing for a higher score is a more dramatized internal conflict on the page; there’s little friction between contradictory impulses in-scene, as she moves smoothly from discovery to contribution. The change at the end (accepting a form of invisible visibility) is believable but emotionally relatively low-turbulence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s inner life is specific and credible, with a clear contradiction between her data-driven identity and her reluctant surrender to the nursery’s demands. Her motives (to understand plant thriving) align with each micro-choice, like leaving moss and weeds or changing how she journals. The transformation feels earned over years rather than a single epiphany, and the final renunciation of control (letting the leaf fall, changing her study method) forecloses her old stance with a visible cost to her self-concept. Slightly more dramatized present-tense friction (e.g., a concrete failure in this storm) could sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The painter’s motivation (“to thresh meaning from experience”) is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, from obsessive painting to following the trails at night. Her skepticism versus susceptibility to the island’s “meaning” creates a credible internal tension that resolves in a way the story has earned. Marcus is sketched efficiently but distinctly, with “haggard awe” functioning as both his emotional state and the mirror she’s chasing. The only limit is that her final understanding comes slightly smoothly, with minimal visible resistance or cost in that cave scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her sensory way of experiencing the cave, her pride in precision, and her sudden doubt all feel earned. The decisive shift from confident oracle to humbled student is motivated by the accumulating evidence of wrongness (shadows, silence in the pearl, the emissary’s accusation). However, she yields very quickly once confronted; we see little real resistance, self-justification, or messy pushback before the turn. The emissary is more device than character, applying pressure effectively but remaining thematically flat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and grounded in her work—“monument to empty spaces” and her “reactive” way of seeing feel particular rather than generic. Her loneliness, guarded hope, and quiet sense of duty come through in concrete micro-choices (ten-second glances, hanging back, then deciding to approach Thomas). The final realization about why she’s archived things is earned by prior behavior, not parachuted in. Thomas is sketched efficiently but remains more function than fully rounded person, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s characterization as a rational, aesthetically minded mapper with a growing need to confront the irrational is vivid and consistent, and her decisive “I dare” feels earned by what precedes it. Her inner conflict—logic vs. hunger for mystery—is clearly implied and threads the piece. The emotional embodiment is largely handled through perception rather than bodily detail, but it suits her temperament. The one weakness is that the “truth” she finds is left so vague that the personal cost of her arc stays more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s interiority is clear and specific—her identity as a “sympathetic skeptic” who still clings to empirical truth feels lived-in and consistent. Her emotional response to the entangled memories is embodied and convincing, especially the vertigo and tears. The internal conflict between skepticism and inherited wonder could be sharpened with one or two moments of genuine resistance rather than fairly smooth acceptance. “Courageously kind” is mostly explained rather than dramatized in-scene, which slightly blunts its impact on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassius and Naia both have clear, specific motives—his boredom and terror of loss versus her desperation to undo an unchosen half-immortality—and those motives drive the scene. Their relationship carries history and resentment efficiently (“the grey space between life and forever, resenting him for it”). Cassius’s internal conflict at the climax could be pushed further; he moves from fear to acquiescence to scheming without quite enough moment-to-moment struggle. Still, the final Earned Stasis—he’s left plotting to overturn reality rather than accept her choice—feels grounded in his established flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is sharp and specific—her “honesty as mathematics” worldview cleanly motivates both her tolerance of and eventual revolt against her father. The father-daughter status dynamic is well-drawn, with Vincent’s reaction (“You’ve destroyed me”) exposing his narcissism and dependence on the con. Her choice to preemptively tell Jacobson and to frame Vincent as “sick” rather than evil gives her real moral complexity. The only minor limitation is that Vincent, while effective, leans toward a familiar con-artist archetype without quite reaching the same nuance Mara gets.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stationer has a clear, particular motivation and a distinctive professional mindset; her studiousness and obsession with “textures of time” feel coherent and specific. Interiority is strong conceptually but a bit cool emotionally—her feelings about the silent town and the ethical stakes of “invented histories” stay mostly at the level of idea rather than embodied conflict. The final choice (“Even here… I will record it falsely”) is thematically earned but could land harder with more dramatized inner friction leading up to it.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s psychology is specific and consistent: her drift into the container maze, her tactile engagement with abandoned goods, and her shift into archivist of absences all grow cleanly from the bureaucratic erasure. Her motivation—to find a way to exist outside official records, then to reclaim her life without losing that perspective—feels earned. The encounter with the harbormaster adds a brief but effective relational crucible, revealing how her obsession with erasure intersects a real family’s grief. Internal contradiction (wanting both anonymity and restoration) is present but could be dramatized a touch more sharply at the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and grounded: a professional myth buster whose skepticism has become both vocation and emotional armor. Her grief and intellectual rigidity are in tension throughout, and the grandmother relationship feels textured despite being off-page. The shift from debunker to someone willing to “live inside the question” is psychologically plausible, if somewhat swiftly traversed. A slightly greater sense of resistance at the climax would deepen the felt cost of that change.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motives and contradictions are vivid: her role as “culture shock absorber,” her fear of solidity, and her loyalty to the raft community all clearly drive her choices. The dual pull of understanding the desire for stability while resisting it is well dramatized rather than merely stated. Emotional states are mostly embodied in concrete images (the foundation chip, the rocking platforms), though occasionally summarized in abstract terms (“hopeful desperation”) instead of being fully dramatized. The final choice—to welcome the newcomer while inducting them into resistance—feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Chen’s motives (to document, to witness, to honor the mountain) are clear and consistent, with a credible tension between scientific composure and grief (“fighting the dawnlit melancholy”). His micro-choices—selecting the crater with moonflowers, perfecting the timing, placing the grain—reveal a hierarchy of values (memory over detachment). The realization on the etched grain feels a touch convenient but is at least anchored in prior setup. Overall he reads as a specific, competent, quietly conflicted individual rather than a stock “scientist witness.”

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s competence, adaptation to blindness, and ethic of repair are sharply drawn and consistent, and her methods feel specific to her. However, she experiences little genuine struggle or internal contradiction under pressure; she is almost serenely flawless. The line “She was a heartfelt artisan…” leans on summary rather than letting behavior fully carry that trait. The relationship with Voss is functional but remains fairly surface-level, serving more as foil than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is sharply sketched—her cartographic mindset, dry wit, and long-term obsession feel specific and consistent, and her choice to finally step onto the ice is well-motivated by years of preparation. Petrov functions effectively as a mild counterpressure and sounding board, clarifying her stance. What’s missing at this tier is a stronger sense of internal conflict or contradiction in Mira—she never seriously wavers, so the emotional cost of her decision remains muted. The endurance/renunciation element is present but not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    The bell tuner is an intriguing archetype with clear, consistent motivation, and a few secondary figures (the baker, Sarah, Matthias) add texture but not real pressure. Interiority is almost entirely externalized through her riddling dialogue and actions, so we rarely feel contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her “infinite patience” is told rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with cost. The town itself functions as a quasi-character, but at a top-tier literary standard the emotional complexity remains relatively simple.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara and Chen have clear, coherent motives—duty vs obsession—and the vial reveals their priorities under pressure. Mara’s internal conflict is present (“Every fiber of her being wanted to keep touching the vial”) but resolved a bit too cleanly, with limited ambiguity or embodied contradiction. Chen’s flaw (compulsion toward the ephemeral) is credible and drives his near-death, but he still reads somewhat as a type (the doomed, awestruck academic). The final renunciation is earned, but the emotional cost could be more viscerally dramatized rather than largely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Matthias’s motivation—vindicating his father and understanding the disappearances—is clear and carries through to his final choice. The lineage of “cry wolf boy’s son” gives him a specific wound and lens, but his internal conflict at the final decision is fairly compressed; he doesn’t visibly wrestle with what he’s giving up outside. The prisoners are sketched with just enough individuality to function as a chorus of belief rather than deep characters. His choice to stay is motivated and consistent, but a shade too smooth for top-tier psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’ motive (answering an inherited debt) is clear and consistent, and Eleanora’s backstory gives her a vivid, specific flaw (“lovingly venomous”) that logically created the curse. His bodily responses to the bead and the greenhouse anchor his fear and compulsion well. The main weakness is that his internal conflict feels relatively untested: he moves from fear to cooperation quickly, with little ambivalence or hesitation before the climactic choice. The forgiveness at the end therefore feels earned enough, but slightly too smooth for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The weaver’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and her occupational grounding (nets, knots, wharf work) gives her specificity. However, she rarely faces live, pressured choices on the page—most conflict is reported as already managed—so we see little simultaneous push-pull of contradictory impulses. Her major shift (from solitary task to leaving the labyrinth for others to tend) feels earned but emotionally under-contested. The interiority stays more conceptual than bodily, which keeps her just shy of fully vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam’s motivation and inner arc are clear and coherent: a diaspora returnee drawn by dreams and her grandmother’s unfinished project, slowly shifting from aimlessness to committed restoration. Her emotional life is embodied in work (moving stones “like a prayer”) rather than label-speak. The main limitation is that her internal conflict remains relatively smooth—there’s little on-page push-pull or real temptation to leave—so her final decision, while earned, carries modest visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Iris is sharply characterized: her profession, history of disappearance, and present desire to “become herself again” all align and inform each micro-choice. The internal conflict between safety and authenticity is consistently dramatized, especially in the hovering-hand moment at the slot. Emotions are grounded in concrete sense memories (mail rituals with her daughter). The final decision to mail the letter feels earned and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mirelle is sharply drawn: her cultivated eccentricity, meticulous intelligence, and limited but determined agency all track cleanly, especially in the exchange with Vas and her sprint to finish the embroidery. Her motivations—protecting autonomous knowledge and documenting “adjacent possibilities”—are consistent and specific. Internal contradiction (fear vs. performance of madness vs. quiet resolve) is present but could be pushed further under peak pressure to reach top-tier depth. Secondary characters function more as foils than fully realized people, which is appropriate for length but keeps the emotional crucible relatively contained.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Meera and the client are both cleanly motivated, and the client’s internal contradiction (anger vs. knowing her sister was right) is sharply evoked in the kitchen-phone memory. Meera’s “fierce tenderness” is consistently dramatized in how she handles the woman’s desperation rather than merely labeled. However, some emotional shorthand (“grief-hollowed face,” “words trapped in the throat forever”) leans toward familiar phrasing rather than truly idiosyncratic interiority. The client’s shift at the end is convincing but almost too smooth, with little resistance once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maricel’s interior life is specific and convincing—her translator mindset, moral weariness, and child-attuned perception all come through, and her choice to commit to seeking the “buried truth” is cleanly motivated by what we see. The contradiction between knowing truth is dangerous/insufficient and still clinging to it is nicely dramatized rather than told. The children and the dead uncle are off-page but exert credible pressure on her values. The only limitation is that we get mainly one axis of her personality (the ethical professional) rather than a fuller tangle of flaws or selfish impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s artistic block, stubborn choice to stay in the fog, and hunger for “real joy” create a coherent, specific interior life. Her shift from trying to paint joy-as-object to joy-as-light is credibly motivated by the fragment and her history. The main limitation is that her internal conflict remains relatively clean—there’s little simultaneous push-pull or genuine risk of self-betrayal. A touch more contradiction or cost around staying in the ruined district would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena is sharply drawn—competent, curious, “methodically playful,” with work habits and perceptions that feel particular rather than generic. Her motivations (drawn to uncertainty, tempted by procedure) plausibly drive each choice, including the ethically fraught decision not to report the discovery. The internal conflict between professional duty and the lure of the mystery is present but could be pushed into a more acute, embodied struggle at the moment of choice to reach the absolute top tier. As is, the characterization is rich and consistent, with a credible, earned shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias and Mara are sharply sketched and their motives—evading cognitive taxation through unparseable thought—are clear and consistent, with nice touches like Linear A notebooks and “candidly cryptic” speech. However, their inner conflict under pressure is mostly implied rather than dramatized; we don’t see contradictory impulses or real doubt on the page. The relationship dynamic (mentor–acolyte, rogue scholar–practical organizer) is appealing but not meaningfully altered by the end. The final stance of defiance feels earned conceptually but light on visible personal cost or sacrifice in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation—to transform suffering into beauty—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice, especially her refusal to sleep for centuries. Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic, with images like “reef-shadow joy” revealing a distinctive inner life. Internal conflict (costly insomnia vs. commitment to the work) is present but remains more assumed than actively dramatized in a peak moment. The final recommitment at dawn reads as an earned endurance rather than a new turn, which slightly limits the sense of change.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miren’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with her role as caretaker, archivist of names, and daughter cohering into a believable psyche. The central conflict—preservation versus transformation—is clearly rooted in her history with her mother and her job’s demands. “Foxglove regret” nicely crystallizes her ambivalence as a character-particular emotional texture. The choice not to repair the chime and to name the new melody after her mother feels earned and visibly costly within this small canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation and flaw (loyalty/fear vs honesty) are sharply drawn and drive every on-page choice, especially her decision to risk a Varesh confession instead of a simple spoken apology. Her internal conflict between precision and “carefully reckless abandon” gives her a distinct, embodied psychology. Marcus is sketched more lightly but still reads as a specific person with legible hurt and guarded openness. The reconciliation lands a bit cleanly—his shift from wounded to receptive feels slightly accelerated—but remains emotionally credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s competence, moral calculus, and inherited ethos (“Every calculation…is a moral choice”) are sharply realized, and her final choice to engineer cooperation rather than pick a side is well motivated. Her interiority is particular—pH of glue, volcanic “breath,” the chain’s warmth—but her emotional conflict is more implied than directly dramatized under peak pressure. The decision to leave the envelope unsealed is a credible, character-specific act that forecloses easier paths. A touch more on-the-page struggle over potential failure or guilt would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s interiority is rich and specific, with clear contradictions between her urge to erase herself and her longing for something enduring (“The paper trails she'd destroyed over the years haunted her more than the lies themselves”). Her past as a pigeon trainer and serial self-reinventor concretely shapes how she reads the attic and responds to Marcus. The final choice to create an “honest” paper trail and set the meteorite as an anchor feels like an earned, modest but real shift rather than an unearned epiphany. The only limitation is that we never see her under acute present-tense pressure from another character; the crucible remains largely internal and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to understand her father’s disappearance and what thresholds mean—is clear, coherent, and consistently dramatized through her tactile engagement with the rail and the logbook. Her interiority is specific and particular (e.g., reading weather codes as emotional states), and the father’s character is sharply sketched through his obsessions. Internal conflict (abandonment vs. respect for his vision) is present but relatively smooth; she moves toward resolution without much on-page resistance. The final stance—choosing to “build thresholds” instead of mazes—feels earned and closes off an alternate life, though the cost is quiet rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Senna’s motives (scientific curiosity plus longing for belonging) are clear and consistently drive her attention and final choice, and her profession-specific way of seeing gives her interiority some individuality. The relationship with Mara is gently sketched but functional, providing a human crucible for the decision to “answer” the city. Internal conflict (duty to Kast/science vs urge to join the pattern) is implied more than dramatized, so the decisive choice to enter the city feels a touch too frictionless. The predecessor is thematically potent but remains more symbol than person, which slightly blunts the sense of inherited cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina is vivid, professionally specific, and her curiosity and persistence feel rooted in long practice rather than generic “questing.” However, her internal conflict is relatively soft: she wants an answer and gets one without much moral or emotional friction, and we rarely see contradictory impulses in real time. The “cheerful gloom” nuance helps, but her final acceptance comes easily, with little felt cost beyond awe and wistfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara is sharply drawn as hyper-analytical yet hungry for wonder, and her “ordering randomness” impulse plays credibly against the inherited jazz/improvisation ethic from her father. Interiority is specific (mapping tourist flows, tide windows) rather than generic, and her talent for reading people is dramatized through Rebecca. The small but telling reversal—being checkmated and called out as bad at protecting herself—nicely exposes her blind spot. The main limitation is that her emotional conflict around grief and control is more elegantly stated than deeply dramatized under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaleth’s motive—to preserve forbidden memory through dance and to inscribe a “cosmic verse” into her own body—is clear, particular, and drives every choice. Her exile, craft, and reverence for her grandmother’s teaching individualize her. What’s missing for a higher score is on-page contradiction or real internal conflict; she never wavers, and the price of this self-transformation remains largely conceptual rather than emotionally torn-through.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Martin’s vocation, habits, and reflective temperament are cleanly drawn, and his realization about his work grows plausibly from his way of seeing light and glass. However, his interiority is relatively smooth—there’s little simultaneous push–pull or real resistance to the epiphany. The shift from malaise to meaning feels earned but somewhat low-cost. Strong, specific, but not yet piercingly complex characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, from his refusal of grafts to his obsessive return to the fireline and final decision to step back. Contradictory impulses—his need to “be the barrier between flames and innocence” versus the cost to his daughter—are dramatized rather than merely stated. The choice to take leave and return the box feels earned by the accumulated backstory and present reflection. A few therapist-adjacent abstractions (“translate everyone’s pain into something bearable”) slightly flatten otherwise nuanced emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and particular—reworking equations to reconcile timelines and reinterpret her grandmother’s fall—and her actions (combining the patterns, rethinking what the equation is for) are consistent with that. The “logical dreamer” interiority feels specific, with good attention to details like the shells and gauge data. Internal conflict is relatively mild; she rarely wavers or behaves irrationally under pressure, which keeps the arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. The final realization is earned but comes with limited visible emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s motivation—answering her grandfather’s question and testing his apparent “madness”—is clear and consistently tied to her profession and temperament. Her interiority feels specific (reading emotion in echoes, the satchel as unwanted legacy), but genuine inner conflict is more implied than dramatized in concrete choices under pressure. The note that her sensitivity makes her “terrible at ignoring what others dismissed” hints at a powerful flaw/cost, yet the story never puts her in a moment where that trait truly complicates a decision. The closing stance shift (from proving to “dreaming with” the walls) is earned but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vesper is vivid and particular—her borrowed heartbeat, liminal working hours, and relationship to possibility all feel specific and grounded. Motivation is clear and coherent with her nature and history. However, we see little genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure; she never wavers, doubts, or pays an emotionally visible price on the page. The “borrowed heartbeat” is thematically rich but could more actively complicate her choices or self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren is sharply etched: weary, self-aware, driven by a belief she knows is partly a lie, with choices (commissioning the clipboard, enforcing the ritual) that grow credibly from her history. Her “operatively gentle” stance and steel-edged interruptions show a specific professional personality under pressure. Secondary characters are sketched but functional as pressure sources rather than people. The main limitation is that her internal contradiction under peak pressure (e.g., during the shouting collapses) is summarized rather than dramatized in a live beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus is sharply drawn: a man who monetizes drought yet carries his father’s romantic ornithological legacy, with specific details (Forbes, ninety‑second showers, the spectrogram journal) rooting his worldview. His ruthless market logic versus the buried pull of sentiment is dramatized rather than labeled, and the final act of smashing the egg feels earned by the accumulation of those contradictions. The emotional shift is perhaps a touch clean—“something like grace fracture through him” moves fast toward redemption—but it’s still grounded in prior beats. Overall, the interiority is precise, character-specific, and tied to concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celestine’s core motive—to break out of enforced chasteness and conformity by freeing the echoes—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Her interiority is specific enough (hearing voices “between sigh and smile”) to feel personal, though internal contradiction is muted; she reads more as a resolved rebel than someone actively wrestling with fear versus complicity. The final transformation from “chaste courtesan” to “liberator” is earned by prior setup and action. Some additional friction—hesitation, guilt, or self-doubt under peak pressure—would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich and specific—his history as a “urbane calligrapher” versus seedy-bar puppeteer gives him credible contradictions, and his guilt over exploitation drives every micro-choice with the puppets. The shift from weaponizing narrative to searching for “half-lit epiphanies” feels earned by the prior beats in the dome. Emotional states are mostly embodied through actions (handling the puppets, the story stick) rather than labels, though occasionally the self-analysis borders on essayistic. The final renunciation of his old approach carries a clear cost—relinquishing a comfortable, lucrative persona.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is precise and consistent—“to honor the forgotten migrations”—and her esoteric realist identity feels specific rather than generic. Interiority is embodied (“knot in her chest eased”) and connected to concrete choices (ephemeral building, following migrations). The arc from constricted grief to “this was enough” is small but earned and rooted in on-page events. The one limitation is a relative lack of sharply dramatized internal contradiction under pressure; the conflict remains mostly conceptual and reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motive—to preserve what love has said when memory fails—is vivid and consistently rooted in her craft and grief. The pre-story forgiveness beat gives her a credible before/after that justifies why she can finally attempt this work now. Interiority is concrete (the specific remembered phrases), though her internal conflict could be sharpened with more simultaneous push-pull between guilt and release in the on-page present. Relationships are off-page but feel real through the idiosyncratic remembered lines.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to understand why paths choose walkers—is clear, consistent, and structurally active from first paragraph to last. Her peculiar temporal perception is specific and shapes how she processes the storm and the bunker. Internal contradiction (fragmented time vs. need to choose) is present but remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete, conflicted impulses. The closing realization feels earned, though the emotional cost of this transcendence is more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The astronomer’s motivation and professional psyche are clear and specific—her frugality, reverence for ancient peers, and “covenant with the unknown” feel coherent and drive her choices. However, we get more declared devotion than messy, in-the-moment contradiction or fear; she never seriously wavers despite spending her last savings and breaking rules. Embodied emotion arrives mainly at the end (“she wept”) rather than being threaded through beat-by-beat reactions. The final shift into tears and recognition is earned but still relatively tidy and unconflicted for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira and Kale are sharply drawn with clear, consistent motives—Mira’s long-game pacifism and Kale’s grief-driven fury collide in a way that feels specific, not generic. Kale’s shift from absolute certainty (“You killed my brother”) to “Teach me” is motivated by on-page experiences (cellular memory, the music box) rather than hand-waved epiphany. Internal contradiction in Kale is present but somewhat compressed; her fury dissolves quickly once confronted with new information, with limited resistance or messy backsliding. Still, their dynamic carries real charge and the final choice feels earned within the piece’s moral frame.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aria’s motivation (retrieve her brother without losing herself to the fog) is clear, embodied, and consistent, and her micro-choices—matching her breathing to the fog, choosing to finish the sextant despite fear—credibly reveal her values. The internal contradiction of being “firmly grounded” yet willing to thin the boundary is quietly present rather than over-explained. The brother is more figure than fully realized character, but his brief lines carry distinct perspective rooted in his obsession with boundaries dissolving. The final reunion feels earned by Aria’s sustained, character-driven work rather than a gift from the world.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marta’s motivations and contradictions (craft pride vs modernization, guilt vs defensiveness) are clear and embodied, and Lena’s disappointment reads credible on the page. Their history is efficiently sketched yet feels lived-in, and the reunion choice is motivated by prior cost. The relationship functions as a genuine crucible: the craft, the contract, and the estrangement are all bound together. The only limitation is that emotional repair happens a bit quickly and smoothly for the depth of the breach implied.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya is sharply sketched: a lifelong curator, methodical yet destabilized, with concrete habits (bathroom epiphanies) and professional reflexes driving her choices. Her motivation to understand and then to accept stewardship of the orchard is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction (fear vs attraction to the impossible knowledge) is present but could be dramatized more sharply under pressure. The final acceptance feels earned, though the emotional cost of relinquishing her old life remains more implied than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marin’s motivation (rescue plus intellectual curiosity) is clear and consistent, and her expertise as an arcane linguist meaningfully shapes her perceptions and tactics. However, she moves through the piece with relatively little visible fear, doubt, or contradiction under pressure; her emotional life feels muted compared to the conceptual richness of the setting. The negotiation moment, in particular, lands more as confident argument than a strained choice with cost. The time traveler is lightly sketched but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to resolve the contamination of her memories and find a bearable “truth” about Soren—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (returning to the ship, following the card, choosing the least-painful thread) all emerge from that drive. The chimera-twin condition meaningfully complicates her interiority with contradiction (wanting truth vs. wanting relief), and her emotional state is embodied rather than labeled. The final choice feels earned, though the specific emotional cost of choosing the “thread that hurt least” could be sharpened slightly on the page. Soren as a presence is thinner, functioning more as pressure/voice than as a fully dramatized relationship in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is clearly drawn—an archivist whose calm, patient, pattern-seeking mind feels specific and consistent, with habits like talking quietly to herself and meticulous note-taking. Her motivation (turning confusion into clarity) cleanly underpins every action, especially the methodical rebraiding. However, she faces little internal contradiction or meaningful emotional risk; her competence is never really tested. The final realization feels earned but not costly, which keeps the characterization from fully high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and concrete—relief for his village and himself from the energy beings’ torment—and his profession as mapkeeper personalizes his approach. Interiority is specific enough to feel lived (“still water…moment between heartbeats”), but there’s minimal contradiction or deep internal conflict under pressure. His choices (descending, trusting the echo stone, sustaining focus) track well with who he is, yet the arc is more competent endurance than fraught transformation. The cost to him personally remains understated, softening the sense of a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Esme’s motivations are clear and consistent—keeping the beacon lit and refusing to believe in accidents—but she encounters little real resistance, so we rarely see her under genuine psychological pressure. Her retrocognition scene is strong, as it concretely reveals how she thinks and how quickly she interprets pattern as destiny. The choice to leave the tower feels thematically right but emotionally easy, with cost only implied. There’s limited internal contradiction; she moves swiftly from doubt to certainty without much friction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elden’s vocation, sensibility (“preemptively nostalgic”), and core motive (to sculpt identity from experience) are cleanly established and tracked into the final choice. Her realization that the nostalgia is not purely hers nicely personalizes the abstract premise. However, the decision to surrender to the archive’s invitation arrives with minimal dramatized hesitation or competing impulse, so the cost is more inferred than felt. A beat of resistance or alternative path would deepen her contradiction and make the absorption more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s shame, professional muscle memory, and tentative hope are well realized, and his shift from “I was” to actively spinning the knot feels causally earned. Interiority is specific (chanting as timing device, awareness of burns, reputation loss) rather than generic. The woman is sketched efficiently with credible status and history, applying pressure without feeling like a therapist. The only limitation is that his resistance softens quickly once inside, so his internal struggle at the peak could carry a touch more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Chen and Mira are both cleanly individuated, with his observational, oblique coping style in friction with her direct need for presence. The physical tells (her twisting hem, his attention to tidal cues) ground emotion and make their flaws particular, not generic. His admission that he hid behind tangents “because facing it straight on would have broken me” is an earned self-indictment, though Mira’s side of the inner conflict could use one more sharp, contradictory impulse. The relationship clearly shifts from accusation to a fragile new intimacy with a real cost—acknowledgment of past failure—felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s claustrophobia, bunker upbringing, and obsession with curated silences create a specific, believable psyche, and her final choice to remain in the sky is well-rooted in those traits. The relationship with her mother, though off-page, exerts real pressure through the memories of bunker lessons and “disappointed sighs.” Interiority is rich and embodied (“carved claustrophobia deeper into Mira's bones”), with a credible blend of fear and yearning. Some realizations verge on articulated theme rather than organic confusion, slightly smoothing over potential contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marco and Elena are cleanly, sympathetically drawn, with distinct roles (guide and grieving parent) and believable grief behavior (her rigid silence, his practiced gentleness). His choices—slowing the gondola, adjusting course, directing her attention—are motivated and consistent with a seasoned operator who’s done this kind of emotional work before. The emotional turn from “flat line” to “possibility” is affecting but slightly too smooth, with little visible internal contradiction at the peak moment. A touch more mess or resistance in Elena’s shift would deepen credibility and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaida’s professional identity and motivations are clear and consistent, and her choices steadily follow from her historian’s ethos rather than treasure-hunter greed. However, internal conflict is minimal—her “wisely adventurous certainty” is asserted rather than tested, so we rarely see genuinely competing impulses under pressure. Embodiment is decent (pulse quickening, the palace recognizing her) but still leans on summary over textured, contradictory emotion. The final choice to descend feels earned but relatively cost-light on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is well-realized as a deliberate, boundary-reclaiming mentor, and the girl’s hollow exhaustion reads credibly through small details like “eyes filled, but no tears fell.” Motivations are clear and consistent, but Mara is almost entirely in wise-guide mode with little on-page contradiction or visible flaw, which flattens her slightly. Emotional states are largely embodied rather than labeled, though the diction occasionally drifts toward therapeutic abstraction (“self-erasure,” “demands and expectations, obligations disguised as love”). The final stance—Mara extending her hand to begin teaching—feels earned but not especially costly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s history with the pyramid scheme gives her a clear, specific motivation and worldview, and details like “virtuously mischievous” plus her quiet subversion of Marcel’s system individualize her. However, in the present scene she moves from receiving the call to volunteering to succeeding with almost no on-page hesitation or contradiction, so her choice feels relatively low-friction. The cost is primarily retrospective (debt, shame) rather than something she struggles against in the moment. A bit more embodied doubt or competing impulse at the bolt-installation beat would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cassian’s motivation—penance through uncovering the full extent of his family’s crimes—is clear, specific, and drives every choice on the page. His interiority is grounded in concrete actions (seeking the archive, handling the cylinder, deciding to go to the council), though his emotional life is more summarized than deeply embodied. There is some tension between pride in his “dynasty ender” identity and the heaviness of that role, but it never quite flowers into a live contradiction in scene. The final resolve to carry this new truth forward feels earned and consistent, if a bit straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The knight’s shame, withdrawal, and fixation on the unfinished oath give him a vivid inner life, and his ultimate choice to dance reads as a credible evolution from his earlier refusal. Motivation is clear and rooted in specific history (seeing the strings at investiture; retreat to the greenhouse). Internal conflict—terror of control vs hunger for meaningful agency—is present but could surface more as simultaneous, competing impulses in the decisive beats. The final acceptance feels slightly thematically tidy, but still earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miriam’s interiority is concrete and particular—her attention to dust, files, and the button reveals a believable, wounded yet dutiful mind. Her micro-choices (following the dust trail, cross-referencing, deciding to contact the historical society) all arise organically from her role and temperament. The parallel between her own abandonment and Samuel’s loss is strong, though that contradiction could be pushed a bit harder under pressure. Still, her final stance of endurance and witness feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation and methods are clear, character-specific, and consistently expressed through her choices (obsolete camera, use of the key, willingness to become “even more forgettable”). Interiority balances concrete perception with purpose, avoiding stock rebellious posturing. The main limitation is the relative lack of on-page contradictory impulses under peak pressure—she never seriously wavers, which flattens potential complexity. Still, her endurance and recommitment at the end feel earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear and specific—protecting his family by “hushing” the prophecy—and his actions track cleanly from that desire. His internal tension (skepticism about prophecy vs. deep loyalty to his grandmother’s legacy) is present but could be deepened with more contradictory impulses in the moment of playing. Embodied emotion is generally strong (“nostalgia pressed against his chest, thick and strange”) but leans more lyrical than psychologically complex. The final shift—understanding hush as embrace rather than denial—feels earned, though the personal cost is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miren’s core traits (orderly, precise, comfort in arrangement) are sharply defined and organically tied to her vocation and later transformation. Her motivation—to decode the leaves’ message—builds credibly from skepticism to devotion. The main weakness is limited dramatized internal conflict: she shifts from rational caretaker to mystic conduit with little on-page resistance or costed doubt. Still, the final state (she has become the message) feels earned by prior behavior and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is specific and believable: the tinkerer hiding under a burned garden, trusting his “uncertainly certain” fingers, and collecting broken timepieces to decode the world’s rhythm. His motivations track cleanly into the climax, where he shifts from fixing clocks to preserving their fractures. The change is thoughtful but low-friction—there’s little visible emotional struggle or cost on the page beyond a quietly embraced reorientation. Still, interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—balancing her alchemical ethic with unresolved grief over her sister—is clear and specific, and her choice to give the magistrate “truth he could hold” feels earned. Her interiority is textured (“luminous regret,” respect for names as anchors) though internal contradiction under pressure is more implied than dramatized. The magistrate, though briefly on page, reads as a distinct presence with legible status and long-term denial. The emotional turn at the door scene and his acceptance of the coin are credible and grounded in what we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s vocation, heretical method, and “modestly fearless” stance all feel specific and embodied, especially in the way she sits, plays, and laughs with the dead rather than dominating them. The shade’s guilt and tenderness toward his daughter are efficiently sketched and affecting. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (competent, almost professional calm mixed with genuine tears and laughter) rather than deeply dramatized. The emotional turn for the shade at the cake/frosting memory is especially strong and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sera’s characterization is rich and specific: a mathematician turned torture subject whose new senses and old obsessions genuinely collide on the page. Her internal conflict—still compulsively calculating while longing for relief—is dramatized in perception, dialogue, and the final choice to stay and “plant.” The old man is sketched economically but with clear history, motives, and a credible evolution of Sera’s possible future. The final renunciation of the mask reads earned and costly rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to find a concrete way to honor erased histories—is clear, consistent, and credibly rooted in her grandmother’s influence. Her interiority is specific (“throat tight,” the remembered demolition of the lighthouse), and her micro-choices (seeking the vendor, using the fragment, staging the exhibition) track with that drive. What’s missing for a higher score is sustained internal contradiction or visible moral friction; she rarely feels genuinely torn. The grandmother-vendor relationship gives a nice hint of status and lineage, but it isn’t put under much pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is sharply sketched: a competent, unflappable technician whose ghost-sight and habit of “looking up” feel particular rather than generic. His motivation—to heed the dead and honor what’s been hidden overhead—is clear and consistent, and his small but real decision to take on the box’s burden is motivated. Internal contradiction is relatively mild; he never seriously wavers between doing his job and answering the ghost’s plea, which keeps the emotional range somewhat narrow. Still, his professionalism, superstitious trust in ghosts, and tenderness around his daughter’s question generate a credible, specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s fear-driven commitment to preservation (“I’ll keep everything safe…”) is clear and credibly challenged, and her micro-choices—watching instead of intervening, whispering “Stop” without meaning it—show real internal contradiction. Her emotional arc from denial of the tilt to gripping the branch as the library “wakes” feels earned. The operator is sketched as a purposefully enigmatic catalyst but still functions with coherent intent and pressure. Stakes for Marina’s self-concept and safety are legible and tied to her flaw rather than pasted on.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kasimir’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent—his failed revolution, superstition about mirrors, and present-day scholarly work all braid into a coherent psychology. His motivation to reinterpret the builders is clearly rooted in his past and his need to redeem or reframe his own failure. Contradictory impulses (cynical obsolescence vs. rekindled fervor) are present and credibly resolved into a quieter, redefined “revolution.” The only limitation is that no other character is on the page to pressure him directly, so his choices never face interpersonal pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aldric’s professional identity, habits, and competence are vivid and consistent, and his motivation to restore the box’s true purpose is clear. However, he faces almost no genuine internal conflict or moral tangle; he’s a highly capable specialist executing a known code rather than a person torn between impulses. The flower as “compass” hints at a deeper ethic, but that never forces a painful choice. The ending registers growth more as reaffirmed craft than as an altered self.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is sharply sketched—petrichor collector, map-lined cottage, practical boots plus mystical beliefs—and her psychometry plus reverence for mystery feel character-specific. Her drive toward places “where explanations fail” is well seeded and plausibly culminates in the choice to dive. Internal contradiction (caution vs surrender) is present but understated; the decision to follow Henrik feels relatively smooth rather than agonized, which slightly softens the felt cost. Still, her micro-choices (returning the compass, filling the vial, removing her boots) track cleanly with her established values.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s artistic motivation and sensibility are clear and specific, and her internal shift from “scaffolding complexity with simplicity” to valuing transparency feels earned. Her perceptions (reading landscapes, imagining past artists) are character-particular rather than generic. However, her inner life runs relatively smooth—there’s little real friction or contradiction under pressure, so the change costs her less than it might. The lack of another on-page character limits relationship-based testing of her flaws and values.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s artistic block and obsession with night-blooming flowers are clearly motivated and consistently rendered, and Father Benedict serves as a credible, softly pressuring foil. Interiority is specific and grounded in concrete objects (postcards, windows), which helps avoid generic angst. However, the internal conflict feels relatively low-friction, and the final realization comes a bit smoothly, with limited sense of competing impulses or cost. The relationship deepens but doesn’t quite operate as a crucible that forces a painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Malik’s vocation, ethics, and temperament are sharply sketched, and Sarai’s burdened resolve feels specific and lived-in. His motivation to bear witness is clear and consistent with his past. The main weakness is the relative smoothness of his acceptance of the lagoon’s price—his internal struggle at that pivot could be more conflicted and embodied for this to be truly top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Miranda’s core motivation—rejecting false comfort in favor of hard, honest rebuilding—is vivid and consistently expressed, especially in her refusal to open the bottle and her abandonment of the guild. Interiority is specific and professional (the “mind’s crucible,” working memory as lab) and aligns with her alchemical lens. However, she faces little real psychological contradiction on the page; her stance is largely stable rather than tested. The “cost” of her choice (exile, loneliness) is implied more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s curiosity and later vocation are clearly motivated, and Madame Verity’s austerity and selective speech feel specific rather than stock, but interior conflict stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in-scene. The child/adult mirroring is elegant, yet we rarely see Marcus struggle against or question the path laid out by the prophecy. Madame Verity’s breaking of her oath is potent but its emotional cost is only suggested, not deeply embodied. Strong, memorable characters, just short of fully excavated.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—save the seeds by risking her inherited time—is clear and consistent, and her fear of touching the vortex versus her duty to act creates credible internal tension. Her experience of “texture” in time is vivid and character-specific rather than generic emotion labels. The final renunciation (spending her grandmother’s unlived years) is well-earned by prior setup but the emotional cost could be lingered on a bit more sharply to reach top-tier depth. Relationships are necessarily off-page, so her tie to the grandmother remains slightly abstract rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s vocation, ethic of “listening over noise,” and quiet stubbornness are clear and consistent, and her choice to override the system feels well-motivated by the established seven-year practice. We get solid, profession-rooted interiority (her tactile reading of the rope, distrust of over-warning), but little in the way of active internal contradiction beyond a generalized tension with the board. Under peak pressure, her emotional texture stays fairly even—competent and calm—so we don’t see much fraying or irrationality that might deepen her humanity. The final endurance choice reads as an earned stasis: she recommits to her way at real professional and physical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motives and inner life are clear and particular—fleeing “noise and certainty” for contemplative solitude—and her behavior (cleaning, logging meteors, tending the lantern) aligns well with that drive. The endurance/renunciation arc from exile to “arrival” is credible, though mostly articulated rather than tested in-scene. There’s some nice tension between who she was (ambitious, armored) and who she’s becoming (permeable, accepting), but those contradictions rarely collide under fresh pressure. The piece could reach higher if we saw her struggle more viscerally with the costs of her choice instead of mostly reflecting on them.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s perceptual habits and ethics are clear and consistent, and her choice to break the covenant by opening and reading the letter feels motivated by what we’ve seen of her. The “contextual clues” passage and her patience with the ghosts do solid work to individualize her. However, her emotional life remains relatively serene and under-conflicted; the decision to violate the covenant comes a bit too easily, with little embodied hesitation or fear. A slightly deeper rendering of her ambivalence or loneliness under this new self-assigned role would strengthen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is specific and compelling—the last “borrowed-time timekeeper” with a clear, consistent desire to preserve and interpret old time. Her profession, secret method, and quiet defiance of the Fluid Timers give her a believable core. However, we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or visible cost beyond gentle melancholy; she endures rather than being truly pressed. Secondary characters function mostly as foils and conduits for exposition rather than as pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren is sharply drawn: her rituals, grief history, and “woven dawns” obsession make her interiority feel particular, and her choices (wading in for the feather, inviting the boy, giving the feather away) all track cleanly with that characterization. The boy is sketched efficiently but distinctly through his attachment to the kite and grandmother. Emotional responses are embodied (wet jacket, heavy canvas shoes) rather than labeled. The only softness is that her final realization trends a bit tidy and thematic rather than conflicted, trimming some messier ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren is sharply etched as calm, devoted, and methodical, with vocation and mortality cleanly motivating her choices, especially the decision to treat the diagnosis as clarification of a “final task.” What’s missing for the very top tier is any real contradiction or struggle—she moves from knowledge to acceptance to action without inner friction, which keeps the arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. The lack of another on-page human character also limits relational pressure that might expose further layers.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—she wants to study “homecoming” clinically yet is susceptible to the pull she’s dissecting—and her gradual shift from skeptic to “reluctant pilgrim” feels earned. Her interiority is concrete (tracking footprints, manipulating the amber) and tied to embodied action rather than abstract labels. Quorum is thinner but still distinct in voice and stance, working well as an external pressure and mirror. The final beat, where she accepts walking the path with Quorum, credibly forecloses her purely clinical posture with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The coachman’s motive—transforming a battlefield into a garden as quiet recompense for years of service—is clear, specific, and woven through his history with the outpost and the dead reef. His interiority is textured (the “familiar contradiction” of confined infinity, inherited understanding of birds), and his actions align well with his worldview. However, he is largely serenely competent; we see little live internal conflict or felt cost in his choices, which limits depth. The piece leans more toward portrait than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Calder is sharply sketched—his grief, obsession with cylinders, and fixation on “distance” feel particular and consistent, and Mercy’s history as a retired corpse-tracker adds texture. However, there’s little real internal contradiction or cost at his turn from resignation to purpose; he decodes the message and commits without much struggle. The settlement remains a faceless mass, purely functional to the arc. Strong, but not yet at the psychologically rich, pressure-tested level this tier demands.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya is specific, coherent, and her relationship to time and solitude feels lived-in, with strong interiority around ritual and mapping. Her motive for staying and her acceptance of isolation are clear and consistent. However, there is little on-page contradiction or live internal struggle in the present; major choices (e.g., refusing to leave) occur in summarized backstory rather than as pressured scene. The ending reads as an earned endurance stance but with relatively low visible cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to repair the guardian’s trust and recalibrate his relationship to secrets—is clear, rooted in his past theft and his new practice of swapping mysteries. The interiority is specific (terror/exhilaration at the sky, the tremor in his fingers) and his moral shift feels earned. However, his internal conflict is relatively gentle; once he arrives, there’s little in-the-moment push-pull between fear and desire, mostly articulated as a realized lesson. The relationship with the guardian has flavor but doesn’t come under much live pressure beyond mutual acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira is sharply realized: her past as a crisis actor, the irony of surviving the real collapse, and her “benevolently ruthless” documentation cohere into a specific psychology. Her motivation—to witness and preserve small gestures—is clear and consistently dramatized. Internal contradiction is present (tenderness vs. ruthlessness) though not severely stress-tested. The archivist is thinner but functional as a foil that reconfigures her solitary stance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Characterization is rich and internally consistent: her fear of her own gift, the self-exile into the mountain, and the choice to embed the stone all grow plausibly from the same wound. The contradiction between wanting safety in reflection and needing to risk direct seeing is clear and active in the climax. Emotional states are mostly embodied through specific sensations (heat, pain, textures) rather than labels. The only ceiling is that the psychology, while strong, leans slightly toward the abstract rather than letting us see more messy irrationality or failure in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Petrov’s interior life is specific and convincing: the exiled tutor who “fidgets productively” and reads the world as a chessboard is sharply drawn. His guilt over the duchess and his gradual reframing of that failure grow organically from the present action of decoding the tapestry. The final renunciation of the labyrinth is motivated and feels like a true, if quiet, cost. The main limitation is that his internal conflict resolves a touch neatly, with relatively little ongoing contradiction at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motives (guilt, defiance, artistic integrity) are clear and consistently drive her actions, and her internal contradiction—wanting forgiveness but resisting simplification—is well dramatized. The elder functions as a credible status foil whose certainty frays under pressure. Emotional beats are embodied through her interaction with the canyon and the penitents rather than abstract labels. The only limitation is that her final stance remains more gestured-at than fully crystallized on the page, keeping this in strong but not elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maya’s desperation, inherited hope, and self-doubt are clear and specific, with motivation grounded in lineage (grandmother, mentor) and present stakes. Her micro-choices—staying under too long, moving crater to crater, surfacing only when forced—track believably under pressure. The shift from “uncertain whether she possessed the skill or merely the desperation” to committed purpose at the end feels earned by what she experiences. There’s room for slightly more contradiction or moral roughness, but the emotional throughline is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s interiority is specific and grounded in her long practice, with a clear contradiction between her detached observing and the hunger the broken mirror releases. Her choices (taking the wrong turn, abandoning the quay, painting on shells, leaving the easel) feel motivated by that buried promise. Emotional shifts are mostly earned through concrete stimuli (mirror, cave, light), though some late realizations are stated rather than fully dramatized. The cost of changing—surrendering her safe, aloof mode—is legible and credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives are clear, specific, and well-rooted in her relationship with her grandmother and her friction with Thomas, and her micro-choices (polishing as meditation, opening the vial, stopping his hand) track cleanly. Emotional life is embodied through tactile perception and sensory focus more than labels. Internal contradiction (wanting to prove an idea vs. not making it about Thomas) is present but lightly touched, so the cost of her choice feels modest. Thomas has a compact but credible mini-arc from certainty in loudness to quiet understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—grief braided with a professionally ingrained need to understand direction—is vivid and consistent, and her decision to become a navigator “of what remains” is credibly earned. The bodily sense of the pull (“fish-line wrapped around her heart”) grounds her abstract drive. Internal contradiction (her susceptibility to the pull vs. her resistance) could surface with a bit more friction in concrete micro-choices. The midnight caller is more function than character, but that’s acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s pragmatic, data-minded solitude versus her reluctant openness is cleanly drawn, and her decision to open the orchard feels motivated by both history and present pressure. The antique-dealer past and her skepticism toward ritual nicely individualize her. The main limitation is that her internal conflict around risking contamination and losing solitude is mostly summarized rather than fully dramatized at the decisive moment, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Magnus is sharply rendered through his habits (“noting what wasn’t there rather than what was”) and long tenure, and his choices around the key and the coordinates feel coherent with his keeper’s ethic. His emotional life is mostly implied through duty and curiosity rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses, so internal conflict stays relatively muted. The “borrowed memories” notion adds a subtle layer of complexity to his sense of self. The final act of pinning the Edelweiss to his coat is a credible, character-specific gesture that earns the quiet shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Martin’s loneliness, professional specificity, and quiet competence are well realized, and his decision to remove the chip and reorient his life feels earned by the preceding vision. The internal arc from skeptical inheritor of a “delirious” myth to someone willing to act on its implications is credible. However, his emotional contradictions under pressure stay relatively tidy; there’s little moment where fear, regret, and desire grind against each other in scene, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully jagged or dangerous. The nephew and other off-page relationships are gestured toward as stakes more than dramatized as living pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The queen’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete history—her father’s choice, her first poisoning, her emotional calcification—so her disillusionment and ruthlessness feel earned. The internal contradiction between her hardened state and the younger self reflected in the starlight reads cleanly on the page and powers the arc. Her final shift toward fear and vulnerability (“disenchanted with everything she had been, terrified of everything she might still become”) is plausible and carries cost. There is a touch of thematic neatness in the grotto’s direct accusation, but it does not undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Solène is specific, competent, and driven, and her motive—to make light hold presence rather than commodity value—is clear and consistent, with Mira functioning as a soft relational crucible. The emotional texture is more stated than embodied at times, and Solène faces little genuine internal contradiction; her choice feels long-made rather than pressured into being. Still, micro-choices like pressing the sphere into Mira’s palm and continuing to work while they talk reveal values and priority. The relationship shifts subtly toward understanding, but the felt cost of that shift could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid, particular, and grounded in concrete contradictions—envy of past selves versus the compulsion to keep narrativizing her present. Her condition shapes emotions and choices (the cabin retreat, obsessive record-keeping, professional path) in a way that feels both painful and plausible. The jealousy of the physically competent, temporally-stable past Maren is especially strong. The arc is a quiet endurance rather than transformation, but the earned stasis at the end is credible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena is sharply etched in a small space: the anosmic ex-aromatherapist who now “humanizes broken things” feels specific and embodied, with her loss credibly shaping perception and choices. Her interpretive leap about Mrs. Kapoor’s need for self-granted permission grows from established traits and history, not ex machina insight. The internal contradiction—someone who repairs objects but recommends keeping one broken—lands as an earned stance rather than a twist. Mr. Chen is thinner but functional as foil and witness, applying gentle, unobtrusive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to reclaim her hands and transform her scars into meaning—is concrete and consistently dramatized through embodied details like the crystallizing fingers and pulsing scars. The inherited stress response and grandmother’s “small magics” create a specific, non-generic psychology. Her final stance feels earned, though the integration of all scars into coherent wisdom borders on tidy. A touch more visible resistance or ambivalence in the last third would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Margot is sharply drawn: her past cruelty, present vocation, and guilt all inform each micro-choice, and her apology and rewriting of the article feel earned by the backstory. The contradiction between her weaponized words and her new role “translating the language of the dead” gives her a rich internal conflict. Vivienne, though never alive on the page, is vividly present through annotations, scent, and the violence of the swirling scores. The only limitation is how quickly Margot reaches full contrition; an extra beat of resistance or self-justification under pressure could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s vocation and motive (“end of history witness” seeking the Great Hiccup) are clear and coherent, and her choice to step into the spiral feels organically rooted in those traits. However, her emotional texture remains largely in the register of awe and realization; we get little contradictory impulse or felt cost to merging with the spiral. Interiority is vivid but more philosophical than embodied. The final change reads as conceptually earned but emotionally under-complicated for elite-level character work.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and specific—professional rigor tipping into obsession—and her decision to experiment with the key arises credibly from that trait and the anomaly. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“shepherding the hydraulic clocks,” “she would understand what clocks really measure”), with embodied cost in the bloodied fingers. What’s missing for the highest band is a sharper internal contradiction or visible ambivalence under pressure; she moves from noticing the anomaly to radical action with relatively little on-page struggle. The final stance—accepting the cost of secret-keeping—reads as earned endurance rather than a transformational arc.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s profession, spatial gift, and obsessive intrusion-mapping all cohere into a specific psychology, and her final choice to delete the number is credibly earned by the button/mycelium insights. The embodied moment of pressing and releasing the spring externalizes her internal conflict effectively. The ex-partner is a bit abstract, so the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, which keeps this just shy of top tier. Chen is sketched efficiently as a catalyst rather than a full counter-force, but that fits the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and specific: a probability professor whose trained skepticism fails around her father is a compelling, coherent contradiction. Her mix of resentment, loyalty, and obsession with the symbols feels lived rather than schematic, and the “theoretically rebellious” detail is well-used to show a blind spot. The final shift—choosing to visit her father with a widened view—reads earned and costs her the comfort of certainty. The only limitation is that the father never appears on-page, so the relationship crucible remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sarah’s conflict between “cultivated estrangement” and her impulse to genuinely help is sharply drawn and motivates every major choice, especially her decision to play the disc and advise the caller to ring his son. Her interiority feels specific and embodied (touching the cold glass, listening to the tunnels), not generic. The old man is sketched efficiently but with enough particularity (dialing his dead daughter, remembering the glass harmonica) to feel real. The final shift—her “Wrong number” becoming an invitation—reads as an earned, character-driven reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s vocation, habits, and quiet loneliness are well-drawn, and her seven years of brown-stained dedication feel specific and grounded. Her motivation to preserve “small moments” is clear and credibly tied to her work with walnut ink. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or sharply dramatized micro-choices under pressure—her realization arrives smoothly rather than through visible struggle. Secondary characters are mostly thematic mouthpieces, but they serve their function without breaking plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and specific—the elusive fixer whose real wound is loneliness—and Emil’s entrance as “rumor made flesh” adds a nicely contrasted counterpart. Her motivations (help people, avoid being pinned down, avoid needing others) are clear and credibly challenged by the gathering. The “desperately jocular” mask is shown, not just told, though the seventeen others are mostly sketched as types. The final choice to let this place and these people matter emotionally is earned, but the internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly, with limited on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sera’s motivations (professional mapping vs. personal grief and the missing mentor/sister) are clear, specific, and drive every choice on the page. Her sensory and cognitive world as a blind cartographer who “absorbs” languages feels embodied and particular. The inner turn—reframing grief from foreign terrain to home—feels earned by the melody recognition, though the acceptance arrives a touch smoothly for such a profound shift. Still, the final stance reads as a credible, costly reconfiguration rather than a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and grounded—her “confident uncertainty,” the worry-stone pen habit, and her reaction to the records rewriting themselves all feel psychologically consistent. Her shift from interpreter to co-author of the signals is clearly motivated by accumulating evidence and by her need for meaning. The internal conflict is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally fraught, so the cost of her final stance is more implied than felt. Still, the arc from skepticism to acceptance is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina and Theo both feel specific and motivated, with Marina’s fear of erasure and hunger for presence driving every choice, and Theo’s belief in her project providing the crucial counter-pressure. Interiority is compact but concrete—her “mapping silence” and watching waveforms instead of hearing music is vivid and character-specific. The relationship has clear status and tenderness, and the climactic acceptance of “presence, not permanence” feels earned by what precedes it. The main limitation is that Marina’s internal contradictions (resentment vs gratitude, despair vs ambition) are gestured to more than explored in depth.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is vivid and specific—keeping a promise and rescuing censored love—and her history as the “lending library arsonist” coherently underpins all present actions. Interiority is textured (“volcanic tenderness,” the remembered grip on her wrist) and her final stance to face judgment feels earned. The internal conflict between self-destruction and devotion is present but could surface more as active friction in the present scene rather than primarily via summary. Still, she reads as a distinct, flawed, driven individual with a clear value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theo and Marquez are sharply sketched, with clear shared grief and an intriguingly fraught relationship expressed through habits (the drumming) and status (she brought him here, she leads the framing). The internal conflict about where one ends and the other begins is well realized, though it leans on exposition (“guinea pigs in a study about the dangers of merged identity”) rather than fully dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance of entanglement feels emotionally credible but its cost—true loss of separate selfhood—is more stated than viscerally embodied on the page. Strong characterization overall, short of fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marcus is clearly motivated (curiosity, pride in mastery, desire to answer the “challenge”) and his competence feels specific and earned. However, his internal conflict is thin—there’s little tension between competing impulses, and almost no felt cost in accepting the inner-circle role. His emotional life is largely implied rather than embodied. The relationship with the woman is functional but not a crucible; she tests him briefly, then immediately welcomes him.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s motives (protect the canals vs. protect her job and siblings) are clear and coherent, and her use of the mirror under pressure gives us a credible, particular sense of her. Internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized—her fear of losing her position is stated, but we don’t really see her waver or nearly retreat in-scene. The guardian’s opacity works thematically, but he remains more emblem than person, with minimal sense of flaw or cost on his side. The closing endurance/stance (choosing this silent exposure over direct testimony) is earned but emotionally could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Miss Chen is sharply etched—tired, perceptive, and quietly radical—while Danny’s conflict is clear but less deeply embodied. Her motivation to protect questioning and his tension between filial obedience and autonomy both read cleanly. The relationship dynamic is well-drawn in dialogue and micro-gestures (e.g., her hand on his shoulder, the queen in her palm). The final ask (“think freely, whether you stay or go”) is thematically apt and motivated, though the emotional cost remains more implied than felt viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira and Kael are sharply etched with clear, particular motives—duty-bound grace versus restless longing—and their dynamic has credible friction (“Pirates don’t own things”). Interiority is concrete enough (calloused hands, phantom weight of obligations) to avoid generic emotion, and the relationship genuinely shifts by the end. However, both are a touch idealized, with flaws and blind spots smoothed over; the choice to leave feels relatively unresisted. The cost to Mira’s dependents and Kael’s obligations remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied, which slightly softens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s coping mechanism, guilt, and ambivalence about his “performances” create a layered, credible interiority, and Emma’s shift from mask to genuine feeling is cleanly motivated by shared history and present pressure. The father–daughter bond functions as the crucible, especially in the hand-holding and bouquet beats. Moral ambiguity around his resistance-by-compliance is sharply articulated without over-explaining. If anything, a touch more embodied contradiction under peak stress could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Meris’s motivation—to reclaim an outlawed, fluid form of poetry—is clear and consistent, and her reverence for the colonnade reads as genuinely character-specific. Her choices (returning first, refusing paraphrase, recommitting despite warning) align tightly with that aesthetic drive. What’s missing for a higher score is real internal contradiction or a felt struggle; she’s almost serenely certain throughout. Kael functions mainly as a sympathetic witness rather than a crucible that exposes more facets of her.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s characterization is vivid and particular—colorblind, reading plants, bartering for “broken” things—and her choice to demand the reed rather than offer charity is a strong, specific trait expression. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or internal conflict; her gift seems entirely under control, and the ethical cost of “bartered awakenings” is only gestured at. Tomás reads as a clear secondary figure with understandable distress but limited depth beyond his function as client/witness. The final realization about brokenness and beauty is thematically apt but feels more like confirmation than a hard-won, conflict-ridden shift.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motivation and history are clear and particular—crystalline vertebrae, post-collapse surgery, and her obsession with the “texture of connection” all feel individuated rather than generic. Her arc from resenting her bells to using them as a tool for connection is strong, but much of it is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. In the live moment, she rarely experiences simultaneous, contradictory impulses; once the volunteer appears, her stance never wavers. The final realization (she sought connection to share it, not study it) is earned but lands as a quiet adjustment rather than a costly internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara is sharply etched through her craft, losses, and quiet but decisive generosity toward Senna; her grief feels embodied in the work with hair, tears, and metal. Senna is sketched more lightly but credibly, with her trembling hands and the brooch of windows as a concrete externalization of her inner state. The line “We’re not making jewelry… We’re making permission to feel” veers toward therapy-speak but is grounded by surrounding specifics. The final choice to keep leaving cranes and to invite Senna into the vigil feels earned as a costly, vulnerable opening rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vesper’s motivation and professional obsession are cleanly sketched and feel particular (her custom cards, the tape, the workaround career), and Marcus’s goal is clear, but interior conflict is minimal and almost no real cost is dramatized. Their rapport forms quickly and pleasantly yet without much friction or status play. The final “I think I’ve found the right collaborator” lands more as a neat fit than as an earned, pressured choice. Strong, functional characterization, but not yet crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian’s motives (forbidden knowledge vs. institutional exile) are clear, particular, and carried through to the closing stance, and her emotional life is embodied (“atoms of nostalgia,” laughing while crying). Internal contradiction—hunger for transcendence versus awareness of its cost—reads credibly in her reactions to the crystals. Micro-choices (removing the veil, going deeper into the archive, deciding to return to the Council) line up with her core values and flaws. The arc is more about clarified stance than drastic transformation, but the endurance/renunciation at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sera’s sensibility is specific and consistent—“sharp-eyed dusk noticer” is earned by how and what she notices, and her decision to preserve older, darker dreams arises organically from the footage comparison and her grandmother’s stone. Her emotional life is largely mediated through reflection rather than embodied contradiction, so we don’t feel much friction between competing impulses (duty to archive vs. rebellion) on the page. The choice at the end carries conceptual cost but little dramatized struggle, keeping the arc more contemplative than pressured. Still, she reads as an individual rather than a type, with a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena is specific, conflicted, and motivated: her fraud, shame, and devotion to the animals all read clearly and cohere with her professional identity. The internal contradiction between believing her observations and recognizing her ethical failure is strong, though her pivot to a new path feels a touch tidy and under-tested. Interiority is concrete (the field journal, the regrown tail, the broken thermometer), with emotions shown through objects as much as labels. The final decision to start over “honestly this time” is earned but could carry more visible ambivalence or fear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her fixation on scars, coffee rings, and plant-memories feels psychologically coherent and particular. Her driving need for closure and her willingness to self-harm to get truth are sharply drawn, with implicit contradictions (curiosity vs. self-preservation, closure vs. continued seeking) present on the page. The choice to reopen the wound and then to reframe her quest as justice by the end feels earned. Only minor softness is that her emotional response to discovering Venn’s role stays relatively contained, leaning more toward intellectual integration than raw, conflicted reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Celeste’s goal and method are clear and consistent, and her choice at the end (redistributing unused love rather than trying to return it) is well-motivated by what she learns. Interiority is present and filtered through her psychometric gift, but we don’t see much genuine inner conflict or contradiction—she rarely feels torn, only curious and reverent. The emotional cost of realizing the original moments are irrecoverable lands, but it’s handled in a relatively cool, conceptual register. Strong, credible characterization, but not yet at the level of deeply fraught or self-divided.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celestine’s motives (answering the call, then choosing imperfection over control) are clear and consistent, and the Keeper’s backstory gives the encounter emotional weight. Her moonstruck perception shapes how she understands the situation and what she attempts. The change at the end—recognizing and rejecting her own creeping rigidity—is motivated by what she’s witnessed. The main limitation is the lack of real inner contradiction or resistance on the page; she tends to do exactly what the story needs with little struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is clearly motivated—she’s a competent, almost priestly worker of probability whose goal of reseeding a burned world is consistent and specific. Her interiority is mostly conceptual rather than emotionally embodied, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or real strain; she performs her role rather than struggling with it. The micro-choices (eyes half-closed, specific wording of the charm, acceptance of the book) reveal values but don’t force a costly trade-off. The relationship with the shimmering traveler is lightly sketched and functional rather than a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.0)
    The philosopher’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific—disillusioned academic seeking the “wild frontier” of his mind—and his actions (trusting sleep, assembling gears) align with that. However, interiority leans abstract and assured; there’s little embodied conflict or emotional dissonance on the page, and his fear is mentioned as past rather than dramatized. The final understanding arrives smoothly, without much felt struggle or contradiction. This keeps the character from feeling fully three-dimensional at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior conflict between safety and freedom is clear, particular, and credibly layered, especially in the “terrified, but also lighter” admission. Her backstory choices (job, relationship, art) concretely root her current paralysis, so the final decision feels earned rather than epiphanic. The guides are archetypal but consistent, exerting gentle pressure without stealing her agency. The only limit at this length is that we see the renunciation of old patterns more in articulated realization than in a truly pressured, on-page choice with visible immediate fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rielle’s drive “to understand what that safety had cost” is clear and consistent, and her embodied struggle with partial sensation gives her a distinct inner life; Silent-Choir’s quiet agency (tea tray, gesture to the bolt, choice to play the anthem) is understated but powerful. Internal contradiction—her need to know versus the pain of revisiting this room—is present, though it could be pushed harder. The final choice to play through the pain feels earned by what precedes it. Characters feel particular rather than generic, with no safety-hedging around their trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Ossian’s motivation as an eternal guardian of true history is clear and consistent, and his calm competence suits the piece’s scale. However, he faces almost no real dilemma: there’s little contradictory impulse or emotional cost on the page as he deploys the rune. Interiority remains relatively cool and abstract, more archetype than psychologically specific individual. The ending endurance—resuming his watch—is earned but emotionally low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s intellectual drive and quiet obsession are clear and consistent, and the legacy from her grandfather gives her interiority specificity. Her realization about the tapping and the ocean’s “memory” feels earned enough, if a bit tidy. Internal conflict is muted—she doesn’t visibly wrestle with competing impulses, just moves toward understanding—so the arc lands more as a deepened stance than a costly change. The emotional embodiment could be pushed further at the climax to feel less purely cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kess is sharply sketched—barefoot, quasi-philosophical, and hungry for meaning—with consistent motives that drive every action. Her micro-choices (crossing wreckage, touching the stone, stepping into the circle) track cleanly with that need. The main limitation is a somewhat frictionless internal arc: her realization about the rebellion’s failure arrives with little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse. The final decision to “begin something older and newer” feels conceptually right but carries minimal felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Naja’s characterization is rich and specific: a weary but stubborn former insurgent whose lifelong defense of tradition makes her final choice to transform herself feel earned. Her motivation to find a “more nuanced” path between Authority progress and fossilized custom is clear and consistent. Internal conflict (fear of Authority and superstition vs responsibility to the land and future) is dramatized, though some emotional beats are summarized rather than embodied. The cost of accepting the spores could be shaded more viscerally to heighten her contradiction and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s characterization is deep, coherent, and textured: her trauma responses, work in the arboretum, and modest deflection of praise all align into a specific person. The “pearl of stillness” practice grows credibly out of her history and nervous-system responses. Internal contradictions—grief vs. chosen hope, obsolescence vs. adapted usefulness—are present without being over-explained. The only limitation is that present-moment pressure remains gentle, so we see less of her at her most contradictory in on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artist’s despair, disorientation, and eventual acceptance are clearly motivated and consistent with her vocation and recent rejections. Her micro-choices—staying in the library, engaging with the cards, arranging them despite danger—track cleanly with her need to make meaning from chaos. The major shift from seeking comfort to accepting confrontation is earned, though it leans more conceptual than richly embodied. I missed a slightly deeper sense of her life beyond the role of “portrait artist,” which would have sharpened the personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s characterization is vivid and specific—his albino body, desert upbringing, and “serene anger” feel integrated with his choices—and his micro-decisions (ignoring the drone, privileging the ink, halting the weapons) arise credibly from those traits. Vera is somewhat more expository, but her ideological drive and willingness to accept capture give her enough dimensionality for the confrontation. The internal conflict between Kael’s duty/anger and his fascination with Vera’s ideas surfaces, but it could be dramatized more directly in the peak exchange. The final stance (taking her in but allowing himself to fully see the patterns) is earned, though the emotional cost could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motives are clear and consistent, and the central moral conflict—truth versus stability—feels grounded in her specific role as sole archivist. Her inner debate (“silence was its own kind of violence”) gives credible tension, and the final choice to wake only one Testimonial is a plausible compromise. That said, her voice and emotional texture lean a bit archetypal—dutiful but troubled functionary—rather than fully idiosyncratic. The cost to her personally is stated more than embodied on the page, which slightly blunts the impact of the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira and Kael are sharply etched, with consistent motives: her commitment to cultivation and his to order-by-force play directly against each other. The relationship is the crucible, and the key turns (her refusal to abandon the farm, his choice to stay for tea) feel earned. Kael’s grief and defensiveness are sketched efficiently through small details (cordite scent, constant readiness, lying about the magistrate). Emotional embodiment could be marginally deeper at peak beats, but the internal logic holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and particular—she’s a professional “fisher” of sound/emotion and is driven by a specific prior encounter with the goddess’s echo. Her cool-headedness under pressure is consistently dramatized (e.g., holding perfectly still while her heart hammers). Internal texture is good but relatively low in contradiction; she rarely feels genuinely torn or morally conflicted. The change at the end—carrying the echo inside her—is earned but reads more as fulfillment than as a hard-won, costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Celeste is sharply etched as a hyper-competent, devoted observer whose grief, doubt, and admiration for her father coexist on the page, especially in the “cowardice or something more calculated?” passages. Her internal methodical thinking (connecting property surveys like star charts) is character-specific and drives action, not just commentary. The final decision to publish feels earned by her re-interpretation of the retraction and her inherited values, though the emotional cost of that choice could be shaded more concretely. Relationship pressure remains mostly with absent figures (father, grandfather, Marcus), so interpersonal crucible is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s guilt, professional competence, and blindness are tightly braided, and her final act—“rewriting her own constellation”—is well-earned by the backstory of ignoring her nephew’s cry. Interiority is specific rather than generic, especially in how her research focus and avoidance are the same impulse turned different ways. The relationship to the dead baby is an effective off-page crucible that still exerts present-tense pressure. If anything, her success inside the machine feels slightly smooth—less visible resistance in the peak beat than her history would suggest.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Moth is distinct, motivated, and embodied through concrete actions (coming to the grotto, drawing, using the tile), and her social perceptiveness feels character-specific rather than generic. However, we get limited on-page contradiction or internal conflict; she adjusts and endures but never faces a sharp, value-testing choice. The old man functions well as a foil but exerts minimal real pressure on her. The final stance—she smiles and keeps drawing—is coherent but pays little explicit emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Layla’s guilt, resistance, and repurposed loyalty are vividly motivated, and her past refusal to burn the plaza cleanly underpins her present act of memorial-making. The retrocognitive punishment gives her interiority weight, and her mechanical hands as both shame and tool are effective. However, her inner conflict is sketched more than deeply dramatized; we’re told she was their “perfect soldier” and is now a radical preserver, but we don’t see many messy, simultaneous contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margaux’s core desire (an encore to stabilize her unraveling self) is clear and carried through to the end, and her synesthetic perceptions give her interiority specificity. However, her emotional life is more stated than conflicted—there’s little on-page contradiction (e.g., terror vs. longing vs. resentment) driving micro-choices in the dance itself. The decision to use the coin and to risk dissolution feels motivated but a bit too smooth, with minimal felt ambivalence or cost in the moment. The “change” at the end—fading into the garden—lands, but its emotional complexity is underdeveloped relative to the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s altered state, uncertainty, and sense of responsibility are clear and particular, and Chen’s “affectionate skeptic” role is nicely embodied in his questions and reactions. Her motivation to help the eight hundred is credible and threaded through the scene. What’s missing at this level is sharper internal contradiction under pressure—she’s unsettled but not truly torn, so her final stance costs her less on the page than the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren’s vocation, solitude, and sense of burden are sharply drawn, and her specific way of perceiving the cave feels individualized rather than generic “empathy.” However, she faces little real internal contradiction or moral tension—her arc moves smoothly from gifted specialist to self-identified “voice of the unknown” without on-page resistance or visible cost, which keeps this below truly top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is clearly motivated by a deep respect for lost things and a growing alarm about the accelerating hourglasses, and her choice to reframe the archive for visitors feels earned. However, her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we’re told her motivation “crystallized” rather than fully feeling the messy tension of that shift. Desta functions well as a catalyst but remains thinly sketched. The final stance (turning the hourglasses “steadily now”) lands as credible endurance rather than a transformative, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is sharply etched—scarred, withdrawn, yet still competent—and his shift from isolation to purposeful engagement is clearly motivated by Sarah’s trust and the ticking loss of the snow-codes. Interiority is concrete (the pillbox worry, fear of looking at the valley), and his choices plausibly arise from shame and loyalty. However, his internal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly into a clean epiphany, with minimal on-page struggle once he commits. The relationship with Emma is functional rather than pressurized, serving plot more than character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Both coachman and passenger feel sharply particular: his ambient, near-mystical attentiveness and her anxious, intellectually driven search for a “true” story play off each other credibly. Her shift from demanding a singular truth to accepting layered truths is well-motivated by their exchange and the palimpsest metaphor. Emotional states are mostly embodied in sound and weight rather than labels, and the coachman’s restraint reads as a meaningful, consistent trait. The only limiter at this length is that her inner contradiction (need for certainty vs. loyalty to her grandmother) could be embodied one notch more concretely under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The potter’s motivation—to understand why some places endure—tracks cleanly from her trek across the wasteland through her dialogue and final choice to carry the lantern back. Her interiority is concrete and grounded in her craft (“that precise moment between collapse and form”), giving her a specific sensibility. However, her emotional journey is relatively smooth; she intuits the answer quickly, so we see limited contradictory impulse or genuine struggle on the page. The beekeeper functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than as a pressure source on her character.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives and values are clear and particular—her care for plants, the inheritance from her locksmith father, and her quiet mission with the mirrors all feel grounded and consistent. Her emotional life is embodied through actions (tending others’ gardens, touching the gauge tooth) more than labels. The main limitation is a relative lack of active internal contradiction under pressure; she largely moves through the night with steady conviction, so her final reframing costs her less on the page than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific—her thylacine past, archival work, and sense of being liminal feel character-particular rather than generic. Motivation (to reconcile two selves and escape “lastness”) is clear and consistent. However, most conflict is contemplative; we see little in-the-moment contradiction or pressure forcing difficult micro-choices, so the final shift reads more as a stated realization than a hard-won turn. The emotional arc convinces, but it could use a sharper on-page test of her competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margot’s occupation and fatigue with being a conduit are sharply drawn, and her final decision to write and then hang a letter to herself feels clearly motivated and earned. Interiority is specific (“grammar of desire…punctuation of hearts”) rather than generic, and her emotional pivot when she recognizes echoes of “every letter she’d ghostwritten” gives the change weight. The internal conflict—loneliness vs. service to others’ longing—could be shaded with one more moment of resistance or doubt at the end, but it’s already credible and nuanced. Sena is lightly sketched yet functions cleanly as a gentle but focused pressure on Margot’s blind spot.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s vocation, perception of the tricksters, and decision to “interfere” are clearly motivated and consistent, and her competence feels earned rather than hand-waved. However, her interiority stays relatively stable—there’s little contradictory impulse beyond cautious worry vs. determination, so we don’t see her pushed into a genuinely costly or morally fraught choice. Emotional embodiment is solid but somewhat generalized (“cautiously hopeful…felt dangerous”) rather than sharply character-specific. The ending offers an earned endurance/stance more than a transformation, which fits but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation (to reclaim the Architect’s Key and the city’s freedom of movement) is clear and coherently tied to her claustrophobia and meticulous preparation, and her embodied fear in the tunnels feels particular rather than generic. Her internal contradiction—prudence versus terror—does operate in scene, especially when she pushes deeper despite the organ’s eerie warning. However, the arc lands a bit too cleanly: her fear releases without much visible cost or mistake, so her endurance reads slightly idealized. The generational link via her grandfather’s compass gives her texture, but she still edges toward emblematic hero more than fully messy individual.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena is sharply conceived—prosopagnosia versus her vocation is rich and consistent—and her motivation to “paint empathy” feels grounded in her history and worldview. However, she faces little on-page dilemma or contradictory impulse; her acceptance of the case and process unfold with minimal internal friction. Emotions are more stated conceptually than embodied under pressure. Morrison is sketched efficiently but never really acts as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation—honoring her ancestor by proving his “reversible exile”—is clear, specific, and drives all major choices, and her mix of idealism and dread feels credible. Her interiority is textured (“spongey dread,” academic carefulness vs burning need) and ties cleanly to her actions. The relationship with Dr. Kao adds a gentle crucible, showing how her conviction pressures someone more cautious. Internal contradiction (fear vs drive) could surface in one sharper, costed hesitation to push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s profession and ethos (“bridge-song fiddler,” “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) are distinctive and consistently motivate her choices, especially translating the scaffold code into music. However, her interiority runs more on articulated mission than on lived contradiction; she adapts to the impossible with little fear, doubt, or resistance. Emotional cost registers mainly as fatigue rather than a true moral or psychological trade-off. Strong, specific character, but the final shift feels more like an elevation of what she already is than a pressured, conflicted change.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marco is sharply drawn—his ranger’s observational discipline, curated sanctuary, and “polished calm” undercut by the “ancient and knotted” feeling give him layered interiority, and the father’s stories make him more than a stock criminal. The core choice (inviting the father to stay, to “break the circle”) is well-motivated by Marco’s history with the startup collapse and discovery of the money. The relationship dynamic—son as territorial protector, father as former predator—feels specific and plays directly into the closing shift. A slightly more embodied sense of Marco’s ambivalence in the conversation itself (not just before/after) would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara and Elias are sharply sketched, with clear, coherent motives (her exhaustion and guilt, his long solitude) and professional identities that feel lived-in. The grief around Ashwin and the daylily telegram gives Mara a credible emotional spine. However, we get relatively little contradictory impulse or real friction between them; once Elias appears, their collaboration is almost too smooth. The final shift toward shared work is earned but comes with limited visible cost beyond acknowledged regret.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is sharply etched—competent, calm, with a clear war-forged past—and her guardedness holds consistently from first line to exit. The apprentice has a credible, ethically murky motive that fits his role, but his interiority is thinner and delivered partly as explanation. Maren’s internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; she shifts tactics (comforting song → war-song) but doesn’t visibly struggle with competing impulses. The final “insight” about fear and unbending fits her but borders on stated thesis rather than a choice that costs her personally.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira and Marcus are sharply, efficiently differentiated (root-bound vs. scattered visions), and their complementary flaws credibly motivate the joining. The “terror and joy braided together” line embodies a real internal contradiction rather than naming it abstractly. Their long pursuit of an “intersection” resolves into a clear relational and ontological shift at the end, with a plausible emotional cost in giving up solitary control. Depth is strong for the length, though their past missteps and blind spots could surface more concretely under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus and the Moth Oracle are sharply etched, with clear, specific motives—the reckless belief that melancholy can be bartered, her guilt-laced commitment to “patch holes” not tear new ones. Interiority is concrete (“it feels like I swallowed wasps”), and their relationship carries a subtle status dynamic (she has power/knowledge; he has need/desperation). The final choice—to endure integrated pain rather than borrowed joy—feels earned by what we’ve seen. A slight softness is that Marcus’s shift toward acceptance happens quickly and with relatively little on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus is sharply drawn, with a convincing mix of competence, shame, and self-doubt grounded in specific history (roadie → appraiser) and embodied reactions (the trembling hands against the rote recitation of facts). His motivation—to reclaim a sense of purpose and trust his own judgment—is clear and drives his micro-choices with the bottles. The contradiction between his technical knowledge and paralyzed intuition plays out credibly in scene rather than being merely stated. Sarah is thinner but still functions as a credible, pressuring counterpart.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Emilia’s characterization as a grieving yet methodical academic is clear and consistent, with concrete details like fifteen years of tablet work grounding her. Her actions—planting the seed, observing rather than recoiling, choosing to bite the fruit—track cleanly with those traits. The main weakness is that her internal struggle resolves very smoothly once the fruit appears, so contradictory impulses under pressure are only lightly dramatized. The final shift from grief to purposeful planning feels earned but a bit too effortless for the scope of the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maris is sharply etched through concrete history (ex-fisherman, the bamboo creel) and present-tense vocation; her calm, craftsmanlike agency feels particular and embodied. Her motivation—to preserve wonder within a predictable loop—is clear and consistent, and her choices (melting identity cards, instructing the visitor) align with it. The young woman is thinner but still credible as a disoriented visitor whose small shift toward recognition is earned. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of Maris’s own internal contradiction or cost in the moment; she never feels pressured or tempted in ways that complicate her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus has a clear professional frame, a believable history of clinical detachment, and a credible pivot when confronted with the shrine and confessions. His emotional shift is grounded in concrete discoveries (the shell, the artifacts), but inner contradiction is only lightly sketched—he changes more smoothly than a truly pressured psyche likely would. The final resolve to “catalog these objects” reads earned but somewhat idealized, with little on-page resistance. Strong, functional characterization, just short of deeply knotted complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s characterization is rich and specific: an ex-hydrologist, newly off medication, using scientific rigor as an emotional stabilizer. Her motives (understanding the river as a proxy for herself, edging toward self-forgiveness) are consistent and embodied in choices like wading deeper and annotating graffiti. Internal contradiction—craving precision while courting emotional rawness—is present but could be sharpened under direct pressure. The shift at the end toward accepting flow over judgment feels earned, though the cost of staying off medication is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and textured—she begins driven by a quest seemingly tinged with revenge and ends in comprehension—supported by concrete objects (the watch, the journal) and micro-choices (entering, mapping, reading, documenting). Interiority is specific (“cautious exuberance,” eyes burning, hands shaking) rather than generic, and the grandmother’s psychology is sharply rendered. However, internal contradiction under peak pressure (vengeance vs understanding, fear vs wonder) is more stated than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. A touch more embodied struggle or hesitation around the grandmother’s revelations would deepen the character.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s ethical dilemma is sharply drawn, with her role as provenance researcher, promise to the monks, and awareness of imperial power all pulling in different directions. The coffee-vision fork into two futures makes her internal conflict concrete, and her eventual “third path” feels motivated by what we’ve seen of her values and cunning. Emotions are mostly embodied through interaction with objects and the plants rather than labels. The only slight limit is that we don’t see much of her personal flaw or blind spot beyond principled ambivalence, which keeps the arc from feeling fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s vocation and worldview are clear and particular, and her reverent professionalism toward the dead feels grounded. However, she experiences little explicit internal conflict or contradiction in the scene; her “determination” is stated but not really tested. The key choices (placing the chip, arranging mirrors) are artistically motivated but low-pressure, so her hierarchy of values under strain never fully emerges. The ending reads as a continuation of an established stance rather than a meaningful shift or renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Keiko’s caretaker nature, complicated forgiveness, and restless seeking are rendered with specific, embodied detail and credible contradiction. Her micro-choices (continuing to bring offerings, how she frames the fishermen, accepting the hairpin) all track with her history. The woman’s “blade wrapped in silk” authority and eventual maternal reveal give the relationship tension and warmth. The only limit is that the emotional turn at the end leans slightly toward neat articulation rather than messier, more conflicted embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s arc from professional absolutist to someone who chooses ambiguity is cleanly motivated through Vincent’s case and the months of doubt that follow. Her interiority feels specific—“conscience for hire,” the worn shard, the way she listens to the overlapping chimes all reveal how she thinks under pressure. The final renunciation of her old business model is earned and carries visible cost (loss of profitable certainty and status). The keeper is lightly sketched but distinct enough, with his own inherited method and guarded openness shaping how he presses her.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The researcher’s motivation—to pass knowledge forward before she forgets it—is clear and moving, and the backward-aging conceit grounds her choices. Her interiority feels particular (“living backward through wisdom”) and ties directly to how and why she teaches now. The student, however, remains thinly drawn beyond fear and curiosity, functioning more as a vessel than a pressured character. Emotional conflict (her sadness at forgetting vs. her duty to teach) is present but mostly expressed in exposition rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael is clearly motivated by duty, tradition, and specialized skill, and his interiority around resonance and memory feels particular rather than generic. However, he encounters little genuine friction—no contradictory impulses or emotional cost beyond serene acceptance—so his arc reads more as a confirmation of self than a pressured evolution. The grandmother backstory adds depth but doesn't generate on-page conflict. The final choice to undertake long work is credible but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and grounded in concrete choices (climbing instead of teleporting, carrying the “worthless” keystone, persisting in failed mist walking). The underachieving self-concept vs stubborn persistence gives her credible contradiction. Her realization at the end—that she was “learning to see differently”—is well earned by the prior effort. The only ding is a slight neatness in the epiphany that flirts with tidiness rather than lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s goal and temperament are clear and specific—methodical, solitary, devoted to her grandfather’s question—and her micro-choices (studying charts, timing the dive, hanging the tag) track well with that motivation. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her work and the harbor rather than abstractions. What’s missing for a higher score is genuine contradiction or pressure within her: she never seems torn between risk and duty, grief and obsession, or staying above vs. going below. The final “translation” stance feels earned but relatively low-cost emotionally, more contemplative than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is specific and appealing—a mathematically minded seer whose “quiet enthusiasm” reads clearly on the page—while Kael mostly functions as a foil and audience surrogate. Her persistence in doing prophecy against universal despair gives her a coherent through-line of motivation. However, she encounters little internal contradiction or moral friction; once she understands the alignment, she moves smoothly toward teaching transformation. The transformation at the end feels earned conceptually but not deeply tested against her fears or flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent; her conflict between love, fear, duty, and self-mercy feels lived-in rather than schematic. The parallel with her predecessor deepens her motivation without collapsing them into the same person. Her choice to reframe her sacrifice (and carry the “sea monsters”) is convincingly earned by what we learn of Daniel and the earlier recordings. A slight tendency to articulate her realizations in thematic language keeps this just short of fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Emris’s characterization as lukewarm, observant, and brittle in his devotion is specific and consistent, and his motivation to fix the imbalance is clear and rooted in those traits. The contrast between his modest power and obsessive attention to detail feels individual rather than generic. However, his internal conflict (fear of failure vs. compulsion to continue) is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in live micro-choices under pressure. The final shift—devotion “no longer brittle”—is emotionally earned but lands a touch declaratively rather than through a sharper embodied beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus and Eleanor are clearly individuated, with believable motives—his duty-bound vigilance and her need for a witness to Millbrook’s resurrection. Marcus’s choice to follow the photographs and then explicitly ask, “Tell me everything you remember,” credibly tracks his shift from pure functionary to keeper of memory. Emotional states are mostly shown through concrete perception (photos, algae-slick steps, the resurfacing town). The internal conflict—duty to the dam versus buried attachment to the drowned town—is present but could be pushed into sharper contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained—she wants the Opus Perpetuum and believes in uniting logic with intuition, and her secret sentimentality is convincingly embodied in the handkerchief and her response to the starlings. The interiority is concrete rather than generic, especially around her awe and the remembered murmurations. However, her “great work would either succeed or consume her” is never felt as a live psychological conflict in the moment; she proceeds with near-total composure, so contradictory impulses never quite clash on the page. The final change in understanding is earned but comes with little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s motivation—to report truth under institutional pressure—is clear and consistent, with good embodied detail (the buckle, the ache in her fingers). Her internal stakes are sharpened by the predecessor’s breakdown, giving her a credible fear of becoming him. The piece could benefit from a bit more contradiction or moral messiness in her—she’s very purely competent and principled—so her endurance feels slightly safer than it could. Still, her micro-choices under pressure (refusing to concede error, demanding trust, methodically explaining) are well earned.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Both Kiras are sharply drawn with clear, conflicting motives, and Kira’s numbness versus Clone-Kira’s intensity plays convincingly through their choices. The admission “I don’t love her” feels earned and costly. A slight weakness is the occasional diagnostic self-labeling (“I came back wrong”) that feels a touch on-the-nose rather than embodied. Overall, the relationship as crucible is strong and the final shared decision is well-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margot’s characterization as a pattern-obsessed, ethically serious escape room designer is clear and consistent, and her final refusal feels motivated by that core value. Her interiority is specific—she thinks in terms of puzzles and patterns—but the emotional experience skews conceptual rather than deeply embodied. The central conflict between curiosity and protection of her creative space is present, though it could be pushed harder on the page. Still, her choice to drop the seed and mobilize others reads as an earned endurance/renunciation rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Martin’s grief-driven ritual is specific and convincing, and his line “I’m trying to fill it back up…The quiet. It’s eating us” crisply crystallizes his motive. Sarah’s shift from ghostlike avoidance to joining him is motivated and believable. Internal contradiction (wanting relief vs. clinging to pain) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices. The emotional palette is rich, though a touch more messy, in-the-moment irrationality could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maris’s dual nature—“feral instinct and an aching intelligence”—is sharply drawn, and her motive to protect the library while fearing the loss of self under dream-pressure is coherent and specific. The internal conflict between beast/scholar and prisoner/protector is active in the present scene, not just labeled. Her choice to risk dissolution by seizing the pendant follows credibly from prior setup. A slightly more embodied sense of panic or degradation at the climax could deepen the cost of that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cassia’s motivation—escaping her father’s failed legacy while needing this commission to mean something—is clear and consistent, and the story earns her final internal shift. Her “hopeless alchemist” identity is dramatized through seventeen years of misfires and the Church’s condescension. The main weakness is that her inner conflict (loyalty to father vs. danger/forbidden methods vs. self-actualization) could surface more in live micro-choices during the rite rather than being largely preprocessed in reflection. The epiphany borders on tidy but is adequately prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (hunger for a deeper kind of meaning in stellar messages) is clear and consistently dramatized through her choices, especially the decision to abandon protocol. Interiority is specific enough—her re-framing of silence and “beginnings in endings” feels rooted in her practice. Internal conflict could be stronger; she transitions to the new worldview with relatively little resistance or felt cost, which softens the arc. Still, the shift from jaded technician to renewed listener is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mateo is clearly motivated, competent, and emotionally legible, with concrete micro-choices (reassuring passengers while privately escalating the crisis) that fit his role. However, his interiority remains relatively thin and unconflicted; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine doubt even when he proposes an unprecedented solution. The emotional cost of his success—what it means to lose the ferry’s liminal “permanently transient” state for him personally—is only lightly touched. The relationship with Torres is functional but not deeply pressurized or transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s vocation, history, and present unease about her own memories are clearly motivated and cohere with her choice to seek the Connection Room. However, her internal conflict feels relatively frictionless—there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk as she moves through the experience. The epiphany arrives smoothly, without much on-page resistance or cost. More contradiction between her professional control and personal destabilization would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Carta’s motivation is clear and specific, and her professional background colors her perceptions in a grounded way. We get small but effective flashes of interiority (“obsession that consumed her waking hours,” “somber marvel”), and her choice to abandon the academy is a meaningful cost, even if summarized. However, on the page she rarely experiences true contradiction or pressure between impulses; she moves steadily toward understanding without much internal resistance. Current-Through-Stones feels textured but still mostly a vehicle for exposition rather than a full counter-presence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivations and professional identity are specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (staying in the atrium at “when the dead call,” deciding immediately to interpret and then act on Margaret’s signal) track cleanly with her history of being “one of those voices once.” Lily, though only on-page briefly, reads as a plausible abused young woman whose fear and hope coexist in her entrance and dialogue. The relationship triangle (Mira–Lily–Margaret-as-presence) is effective but not deeply conflicted; Mira never faces a hard internal contradiction or visible cost for helping, which limits the depth of her arc. The endurance/stance at the end (she’ll keep doing this, calling advocates) is credible but emotionally safe, keeping this short of truly searing characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation—to honor Kove and bear witness—is clear and consistent, and her claustrophobia vs. professional drive gives her a credible internal tension. Embodied reactions (“compression in her chest,” walls “pressing inward”) keep her from feeling generic. However, her interiority stays relatively clean and virtuous; we don’t see messier contradictions or selfish impulses under stress. The closing resolve to make Kove remembered is emotionally earned but could carry sharper, more ambivalent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s guilt, obsessive heartbeat-counting, and need to “fetch wisdom from failure” give her a specific, embodied psychology, and her choice to use the shard and ink as a last-ditch approach feels motivated and character-true. The internal shift from self-blame to understanding Chen’s agency is earned by the on-page discovery, not granted cheaply. There is some tidy emotional packaging in the final peace, but it still reads as the culmination of sustained pressure. The lack of an on-page secondary character means relational dynamics don’t test her further, but for a single-POV piece this is robust.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sarielle’s drive—to preserve a dead tactile language by transforming it—is clear and consistent, and her copper-veined body is a strong, character-specific detail. Her micro-choices (studying the birds, deciding the diamond transforms rather than steals, working through the night, leaving the diamond behind) feel motivated and cohere into an earned renunciation. What’s missing, at this level, is more palpable inner contradiction or doubt under pressure; she moves from hypothesis to execution with little emotional friction. The cost (worn fingers, dimmed veins, relinquishing her unique role) is there but could bite harder if her attachment to being the last speaker were more conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya is sharply drawn: the professional mask, the decade of bitterness over Voss, and her cracking skepticism (“what if it’s actually beautiful?”) all feel rooted in concrete history and present stimuli. Her motives are clear and specific—expose the phenomenon as payback for loss—yet she’s credibly seduced by what she’s supposed to analyze. The internal turn toward longing/hope at the end is earned but not yet pushed into an irrevocable choice. Old Marrow functions well as a pressure-bearing foil, though he remains more archetypal than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motive—to reawaken buried magic/beauty—is clear and consistent, and her actions (slipping into the orchard, choosing a dangerous melody, refusing to stop playing as the violin cracks) align with it. Interiority is present but a bit generalized; we don’t see much live contradiction or fear, only the assertion that her idea is dangerous. The final understanding about “continuous becoming” fits her journey but reads slightly thesis-like rather than arising from a sharply dramatized personal cost. Strong, but not yet at the level of deep, messy, individualized interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s vocation, values, and tactics feel coherent, and her professionalism under pressure is well-drawn, especially in her use of the null-field and respect for silence with Samir. However, her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized—she reflects on being “trapped and trying to remain powerful” but rarely faces a moment where her principles seriously conflict with self-preservation or duty. The motivation to help Dr. Khoury’s daughter is affecting but relatively frictionless. The final stance (continuing the work, “already planning tomorrow’s routes”) feels like an extension of the opening state rather than a sharpened renunciation with explicit cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carpenter’s worldview and motives are clear, specific, and embodied in his craft, with lovely occupational detail (“his hands remembered every curve of wood”). However, his internal life remains largely unconflicted; we see endurance and devotion but not much in the way of simultaneous, contradictory impulses. The ending is more a continuation of an established stance than a costly new choice. That keeps the characterization strong but not yet at a transformative, top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cordelia’s motivations (prime-number boundaries, the grandmother’s legacy, the theory about where stories live) are coherent, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions. Her interiority is vivid without lapsing into therapy-speak, and her sanely eccentric worldview feels lived-in rather than quirky for its own sake. The main limitation is that we see little genuine internal conflict or cost—she’s searching, but not clearly torn between incompatible impulses on the page. The final stance (serene acceptance of the pocket dimension) is earned but emotionally low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation to find Theo is clear and sustained, and her professional role as librarian nicely contrasts with her secret work. However, much of her arc is summarized rather than dramatized, so we rarely see her under immediate, concrete pressure. The pull between her duty to the library and to Theo/dreams is gestured at but not deeply conflicted on the page, making the final renunciation feel relatively frictionless. Theo is more concept than person, which works thematically but limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s fear, grief, and latent courage are clearly motivated by her sister’s disappearance, and her micro-choices at the nexus (not closing her eyes, following the coordinates) track cleanly to that drive. The transformation into “a new locksmith” is earned but somewhat low-friction, with little sense of what she sacrifices beyond implied normalcy. The sister is sketched effectively via specific traits (“unassumingly bold”) that explain the ribbon’s existence. The locksmith is purposefully opaque, but their motivation and emotional texture remain more concept than person.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s characterization is specific and consistent—her tactile folklorist instincts, stubborn curiosity, and grief over vanishing memories clearly drive her choices, especially the moment she breaks her own protocols to pluck the mushroom. The interiority is concrete (soil-stained hands, remembered songs) rather than generic. The central contradiction—archivist who must now dismantle an archive—is present but could sharpen further with a slightly harsher sense of risk or self-doubt in the harvesting sequence. The final shift from “preserved” to “living” memory feels earned and aligned with her established values.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archivist and Finn feel psychologically coherent, with clear, particular motives and small but credible contradictions (her nervous walking backward; his barbed skepticism masking need). Their relationship acts as the crucible, with status shifting as Finn moves from mocking to asking questions. Some lines veer into tidy therapeutic articulation (“They exiled their fear onto you”), which slightly undercuts the rawness of their pain. The final micro-change—Finn beginning his own annotations—is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara is specific, competent, and grounded in concrete history (forty years on the cliff orchards, family lineage with the seed), and her actions align cleanly with her stated goal. However, she’s almost entirely composed of virtues; there’s little contradiction, doubt, or moral friction under pressure. The ritual goes smoothly once begun, so we don’t see her make a painful trade-off or reveal a sharper flaw. The resulting “change” at the end reads more as fulfilled function than a charged personal evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s role and methods feel specific and grounded, and the fisherman’s guilt is cleanly motivated through the net of unreported drownings. Interiority is present but relatively light; we understand what she does more than who she is beyond her craft. The fisherman’s emotional progression from fragmented to solid is strong, though his inner contradictions are summarized more than dramatized. The final release is earned but psychologically a bit smooth, with little residual ambiguity or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is crisply drawn as meticulous, perceptive, and quietly driven, with her cartographic mindset shaping how she sees everything. Her motivation—to understand the vault’s “whispers” rather than fear them—is clear and consistent. However, her emotional life remains relatively cool and controlled; we get little embodied contradiction or felt risk beyond quickened heartbeat. The closing choice to leave the doors open and step toward the unknown is earned but not heavily costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena is sharply etched: a death-haunted, hyper-competent explorer whose grief history (sister, Amelia) cleanly motivates her presence and choices. Her internal contradiction—compulsion to solve vs the dawning sense that solving hollows things out—feels specific and credible. The final renunciation of the snow globe is well-earned by prior beats. A touch more embodied, in-the-moment emotional friction (hesitation, bodily resistance) around that choice could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Moth’s vocation and temperament are clear and consistently rendered, and her motivation—to give voice to unspoken needs—is well established. However, she faces little genuine pressure or internal contradiction; there’s no moment when her values visibly cost her anything. The ghost’s interiority is only sketched at a distance, limiting the relational crucible. The result is appealing but emotionally safe characterization rather than something fully lived-in and pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her inner world feels specific: a servant craving understanding rather than treasure, drawn to the captain’s legacy. Her decisive turn—rejecting promotion-as-detachment to pursue a more engaged form of service—is well earned by prior interiority. However, her conflict is relatively tidy, with little real friction between contradictory impulses in scene; she reasons her way to change rather than struggling toward it. Some emotional language (“warmly inquisitive nature,” “transform grief into something bearable, even beautiful”) leans toward generalized labels rather than fully embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s professional competence, inherited obsession, and quiet defiance of institutional norms are specific and convincing, and her emotional responses to different cloud types feel genuinely character-rooted rather than generic. However, her internal contradiction (risk to career vs need to pursue this “unauthorized project”) stays mostly conceptual; we don’t see a real-time push-pull or a difficult trade-off on the page. The “emergency” of the broken tether never forces a truly conflicted choice, so her endurance feels relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The artist’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in her unusual relationship to faces and touch; her motives (proving herself, honoring the commission, wrestling with limits) are consistently dramatized. Her final stance—accepting honesty over perfection and leaving without “recognition”—is credibly earned. The piece could deepen embodied emotion and contradiction under peak pressure (more felt panic, resentment, or denial as dawn nears) to push the arc from strong to indelible. As is, she feels psychologically coherent but slightly too composed.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Celeste’s curiosity and pattern-obsessed mind are rendered specifically, and her small but meaningful choices (investigating the hopscotch, decoding the sequence, erasing the chalk, deciding to proceed covertly) feel well motivated. The tension between her “diligently curious” nature and the need for caution around the Guild is credible, though the danger remains mostly conceptual. Interiority is distinct and non-generic, but her emotional experience could be embodied a bit more under peak discovery. The final stance—quiet, risky resolve—is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Miren is clearly motivated, competent, and particularized through her craft background and inheritance from her grandmother, and her respect for imperfection in mechanisms gives her an identifiable worldview. However, internal conflict is muted: she rarely feels genuinely torn or at risk beyond a generalized melancholy and concern for the world. The crucial improvisation with the irregular Perseids gear is smart and characteristic, but doesn’t quite expose a deeper flaw or contradiction. The endurance/change at the end (accepting imperfection) is thematically apt but emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent, and her long historical perspective gives her interiority some texture, though her internal conflict remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in scene. The colonists are sketched efficiently, with Joren and Elissa registering as types more than fully individuated people. The encounter with Kessa near the end effectively humanizes Mara and hints at her loneliness and need for connection. The closing shift from “doing it alone” to shared effort is earned but emotionally relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific: a child recruited for her pattern-sight who has grown into a weary guardian, driven by the desire to “whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes.” Her emotions are embodied in trembling hands, the weight of the bag, and the way she cradles the puppet head, not just labeled. There is credible internal contradiction between awe at touching infinity and the ache of responsibility, especially in “bruised awe” and “beautifully flawed in her attempts to matter.” The main limitation is that her flaw set remains more thematic than decision-complicating; she endures the burden rather than facing a sharp on-page dilemma that forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s reluctance and gradual acceptance are clear and consistent, and her competence under pressure feels earned by prior experience. However, her internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in on-page moments of doubt or temptation to abandon the travelers. The travelers themselves are thin, functioning more as stakes than as characters. The final acceptance of her role is credible but could land harder with a more embodied cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s grief, guilt, and analytical bent are integrated into a specific, believable psychology, and her arc from paralysis to a tentative reconnection is earned by prior beats. Her retreat into polymer chains as a surrogate for human connection is especially sharp. Internal contradiction (need for connection vs self-isolation) is present but could surface even more in on-the-spot hesitation around scattering the ashes. Occasional explanatory phrasing (“what she needed to atone for”) edges toward telling, but not enough to undercut the core integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Vera’s role and worldview are sharply drawn through her work (“clean slate vendor,” quantifying absence), and the customer’s motivation is clean and specific. However, Vera experiences little visible internal conflict or cost; she understands and knows what to do almost immediately. The man is more emblematic than individuated, functioning as a vessel for the theme. The final “change” is more situational (first sale, rebalanced library) than a deeply earned internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maron’s characterization is specific and embodied—his sensory lexicon, his training as a chef, and his practiced boundary-setting with memories all feel lived-in and coherent. His motivation (to relieve the world’s leaking remorse) is clear and consistent, with enough ambivalence in “gift—or curse” to keep him from reading as a simple savior. Amira is sketched efficiently yet distinctly, with her refusal to touch him and her role as keeper embedding status and history. The main limitation is that Maron’s internal conflict under peak pressure is suggested more than dramatized; he rarely feels in genuine danger of moral or psychological collapse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation and vocation are clear and particular, and her choice to repurpose the cuckoo weight is well-rooted in her desire to reconnect the valley. However, her interior conflict is relatively light: the risk of acting without consent and of damaging tradition is acknowledged but not deeply felt on the page. Emotional states are more often summarized than embodied, especially around the “empathetically decisive” moment. The closing realization about her role lands, but with a touch of tidy epiphany rather than complex contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motives and professional background are clear and specific, and her choice to become a “bridge” for abandoned dreams feels organically grounded in her expertise. However, her internal life runs mostly in one direction—toward revelation—without much on-page contradiction or genuine resistance, which makes the epiphany feel a bit smooth. Her emotions are more conceptual than embodied in key moments, dampening the sense of personal cost. Still, she reads as a distinct, coherent character rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s prism-minded archivist identity is clear, specific, and well-integrated with her way of seeing the world and interpreting marginalia. Her motivation to access hidden combinations is consistent and plausibly rooted in her temperament. However, she faces little genuine internal conflict or moral friction; there’s no meaningful struggle between competing impulses in the moment. The ending change feels more like an upgrading of capacity than a choice with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s artistic motivation and perceptual habits are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices in the workshop (mapping each insulator’s “voice,” adjusting tensions) reveal a clear hierarchy of values. However, she encounters little inner contradiction or genuine doubt; her competence is never under serious emotional pressure, which slightly flattens her arc. The final endurance—playing until her fingers ache—is credible and earned but more a confirmation of who she already is than a turn that exposes a new flaw or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kavir’s motivations (exiled for critical thinking, returning not for vengeance but for ethical repair) are clear and consistent, and his interior shift from strategist to listener feels earned. His exile, guilt, and tenderness toward the Hierophant’s daughter all register in concrete detail. The internal conflict is present but relatively smooth; he encounters little genuine temptation to act otherwise in the on-page moment. The relationship with the daughter is efficient and charged, though a hair more friction between them could deepen the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marlow’s motivation—to reach her sister without violating her—runs cleanly through every choice, culminating in the earned, costly decision to close the diary unread. Her history (protest singers, monks, “radio archaeologists”) feels particular and informs both method and ethics. The internal conflict between the desire to know and the commitment to non-violence-in-listening is present, though occasionally phrased in slightly abstract, essayistic terms rather than fully embodied contradiction. Elena is vivid in absence, but remains more symbol than person, which keeps this just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s ambition, sensitivity, and capacity for reflection are specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (enduring the stench, meticulous journaling, opening her windows, sharing her notes) track clearly to her motives. The internal shift from pure ambition to a more tempered acceptance is earned, not declared out of nowhere. However, her contradiction—wanting control yet learning to accept discomfort—could be dramatized under sharper pressure rather than mostly in reflective summary. Relationships are largely off-stage, so we don’t see her flaws tested against another person in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and nicely rooted in both professional competence and private obsession (the arrow tip), and her micro-choices under pressure (killing the engine, trusting water over instruments, entering the echo clearing) all follow. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper internal contradiction or visible cost—she rarely feels truly torn or degraded by stress. Her realization at the end feels earned but not especially hard-won emotionally. The story reads more as a successful quest than a crucible that exposes deep flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s professional competence, legacy from her father, and evolving stance on “foresight” are clearly motivated and consistent. Her micro-choices—following the wind deeper into the maze, prioritizing documentation, transmitting findings—track believably with that profile. However, her emotional life remains relatively cool and contained; the patch’s “weight” is noted but rarely complicated by sharper contradictions or embodied stress. Chen functions mostly as an information relay rather than a pressure source on her.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s motivation—to prove wonder is essential—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her actions from descent to cavern to striking the ice column. Her synesthetic interiority feels embodied and character-particular, not generic. However, she experiences relatively little on-page internal contradiction or real doubt; she is largely steadfast, so the final reframing (“she hadn’t saved the bells”) is more conceptual than emotionally costly. The arc lands, but with less visible struggle than this premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s motivation—fifteen years of baffled guardianship curdling into a need to understand—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Her interiority has some specificity (“potential, coiled and waiting”), but her emotional conflict (duty vs curiosity vs fear of failure) is more stated than dramatized in clashing impulses on the page. The final choice to step through the fold is motivated and legible but reads relatively smooth, with limited felt cost. Still, she feels like a distinct, competent person rather than a stock “Keeper” archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The operator’s interiority is vivid and particular—her dissolution into borrowed personalities, her tactile engagement with the halo fragment, and her mathematician persona all feel specific and grounded. Motivation (to crack the mathematics of emotion, possibly to avert further collapses) is clear and consistent. However, her internal conflict—mission versus loss of self—remains more implied than dramatized in a concrete choice, limiting the felt cost. The closure beat is an endurance/continuance rather than a sharp turn, which is credible but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s characterization as a dutiful yet anxious courier with unresolved attachment to Master Venn is clear and consistent, and his small transgressions (kneeling, accepting the seed, lingering with strangers) embody his internal pull toward wonder over procedure. However, his interior conflict stays relatively safe and lightly sketched; we don’t see a genuinely difficult trade-off or a moment where his obedience meaningfully contends with his growing curiosity. Secondary characters are vivid but mostly benevolent catalysts rather than sources of pressure. The final shift—accepting the relic’s purpose and deciding to plant the seed—feels earned but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena and Hartley both have clear, specific motivations (validation vs. fear of what belief implies) and a legible history that informs their present tension. Hartley’s confession about his wife and the car credibly reconfigures him from skeptic to ally with visible emotional cost. Interiority is mostly economical and concrete, though Elena’s inner conflict about needing both mystical and institutional validation could be pushed one notch deeper. The relationship shifts from estrangement to charged collaboration in a way that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mariko’s motivation to retrieve Kenji at the cost of herself is clear, consistent, and rooted in specific history with her grandmother and brother. Her craft choices (hair, bamboo, spider silk) embody her dedication well. The main limitation is the relative smoothness of her decision; internal conflict is implied rather than substantially dramatized in-scene, so competing impulses never fully clash on the page. The sacrifice feels earned but not agonized over.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply drawn as quiet, exhausted, and doggedly skilled; her overlooked status and stubborn hope clearly motivate her exploration of the mines and the conduit plan. Her emotional life is present but relatively streamlined—there’s little contradictory impulse or real fear of failure on the page. The magician is efficiently sketched with a distinct presence and a nice status reversal when he recognizes her resolve. The closing choice to return to the forge and commit to vast, quiet work feels earned by everything we’ve seen of her.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and embodied—her sensory mapping, grief, and intellectual curiosity all feel integrated, and her final choice to defer a decision reads as an earned endurance stance. The love for Mira is convincingly the engine behind every choice. Internal contradiction (wanting her sister vs understanding the cosmic cost) is present but could be dramatized more directly in the moment of almost-reaching for reunion. Mira, while compelling, functions more as an exposition vector than as a fully pressured on-page presence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s reticence, observational bent, and eventual decision to write give her a clear, earned mini-arc, and Marcus’s motive to “become the light his drowned wife never reached” is specific and moving. Her interiority is largely concrete and character-particular (“carrying other people’s loneliness like cargo”), not generic. The final choice to write and sign as “The Reticent Skipper” is well-motivated by prior beats. A slight safety hedge remains in how cleanly she accesses and articulates her insight under acute stress, softening the messiness of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s mix of absurdist laughter, lonely duty, and reluctant reverence for the lighthouse reads as specific and coherent, and his accidental prophecy trait is dramatized rather than merely labeled. His motivation—to keep performing a half-forgotten ritual in hopes of shaping dawn—is clear and aligns with every action. The piece leans more on stabilized endurance than on a visible inner change, so the final “choice” is less a turn than a reaffirmed stance. That keeps this just short of the most powerful characterization bands, but it’s still textured and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and specific (to understand the donor-heart’s strange pull on strangers), and her embodied reactions (hand to chest, gripping the table) ground her emotionally. Chen’s characterization as a meticulous, almost mystical craftsman is vivid and consistent, with his “pattern recognition” ethos mapping cleanly onto his choices. Internal conflict (gift she “didn’t ask for” vs. emerging sense of purpose) could be dramatized with a bit more friction or wrong-footed impulse in-scene rather than mostly in summary. The final decision to stay is earned but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is clearly motivated (professional duty plus genuine curiosity about what trees witness) and her competence feels grounded in the maintenance-worker frame. However, she experiences little real internal contradiction or stress; the work unfolds smoothly, so we rarely see competing impulses under pressure. Emotional embodiment leans more conceptual than visceral, which slightly mutes her arc. The closing realization is earned but comes with limited on-page cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elora’s role, history, and emotional burden are clearly established, and her micro-choices (attempting the weaving now, pouring specific memories into the ritual, persisting to exhaustion) feel motivated and coherent. The sense of being a “scattered memory keeper” is embodied in how she handles the window, fruits, and song rather than just labeled. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she worries about being consumed by memories yet we never see that danger actively threaten her during the ritual. The final renunciation (letting the song continue without her) is earned and carries a modest but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Iris is sharply drawn as a “compassionate recluse,” with her misbelief about distance-as-love anchored in the sister’s wedding and her aversion to gatherings. Her interiority feels specific (“waiting without waiting, present but elsewhere”) and her choice to come to the Library is clearly motivated by guilt and longing. The contradiction between her empathy and withdrawal is well-articulated but mostly pre-processed before the scene, so we get less in-the-moment struggle than this premise could support. The elderly woman is effective if slightly archetypal, functioning more as guide than as a fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s motivation—compulsively documenting vanishings—is clear, particular, and drives every choice, including her initial challenge to the woman and eventual acceptance of the seeds. The old woman’s backstory as archivist turned gardener both personalizes and deepens the philosophical conflict. Mira’s shift from grief-stricken recorder to someone willing to enact transformation is credibly earned. The only slight limitation is that her internal contradiction (need to control via record vs. openness to change) could be surfaced just a bit more in embodied reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is sharply etched: solitary, dutiful, and quietly devotional, with motives that clearly align to her work and history. Her emotional reactions (the hum of frequencies, the danger of frozen tears) feel embodied rather than labeled. Internal conflict is present but muted—she’s more consistent than contradictory—which keeps this just shy of exceptional depth. The final choice to sequester the slide and write in her private journal is well motivated and reveals a convincing hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Nelle’s motives and history are cleanly articulated, and her preparation with the recordings shows competence under pressure. Her emotional life is suggested (flutter in her chest, carrying her father’s silence like armor) but internal contradiction could be deepened further in-scene. Crenshaw’s role and attitude are sketched efficiently with a clear power dynamic. The final stance—her hard-won, wary endurance—feels earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is vivid—her “luminous skeptic” stance, taste-sensing, and fixation on the compass and weather-carriers all cohere into a specific psyche under a clear motive. The sibling dynamic with Kael gets a meaningful reconfiguration, but his side of the conflict is lightly sketched and resolves quickly. Internal contradiction (skeptic who believes in emergent meaning) is present but under-exploited at moments of pressure. The emotional cost of her choice to walk away from the councils is more told than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motives are clear and coherent—grief, inherited “curse,” and the need to understand and redeem her mother’s choices—and her final decision to draw on the cave walls grows credibly from these traits. Interiority is specific (“mnemonically gifted mind,” subway sketches) and embodied through recurring charcoal-stained hands. The main weakness is that her internal conflict is often explained rather than dramatized in micro-choices under resistance; she moves fairly smoothly from repression to catharsis. The mother–daughter dynamic is powerful but one-sided and largely conveyed in exposition rather than present-tense friction.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s lie-sensitivity, shrinking under dishonesty, and craft as a calligrapher cohere into a clear, particular psychology, and her final choice to become a carrier of truths is well-motivated by what precedes it. Her embodied reactions to lies and to the Archive are concrete without drifting into diagnostic language. Internal tension—comfort in preservation vs unease that the truths remain undelivered—emerges nicely in “But they're still unspoken.” The caretaker is thinner as a character and functions more as a mouthpiece, but given the length that doesn’t undercut Mira’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivations (pursuit of “symphonies of truth,” then the shift toward preserving wonder and teaching others) are clear and consistent with her craft and muteness. Interiority is specific—her response to the altered bell tones and to the pilgrims’ faces feels grounded and embodied. However, internal conflict is relatively gentle and mostly conceptual (perfection vs. imperfection), with little sense of risk or real struggle. The final stance feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    M4-RY’s motives are clear, specific, and organically escalated from dutiful caregiving into a need to resolve the “static” that threatens their function, culminating in the choice to bury the photo instead of erasing it. The interiority feels particular to an android built to nurture and remember yet corroded by nostalgia. The core flaw—self-blame over the lost child—credibly drives their compulsive collecting and the burn plan. The final renunciation (not erasing but transforming the memory) is emotionally earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marissa is clearly motivated by a belief in listening and community, and her professional lens as a curator informs her choices in a specific way (noticing the locket, reading objects as voices). However, she is almost entirely competent and morally aligned, with little visible inner conflict or contradiction under pressure. Secondary characters (Thomas, Jorge, Mrs. Abernathy) are sketched efficiently but remain functional voices rather than fully individuated forces. The final stance—“We’ll need each other first”—is consistent and earned, but costs and flaws are relatively muted.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is vivid, competent, and clearly motivated by legacy, politics, and an ethic of transforming vulnerability, and her professional lens on code as “poetry” feels specific and embodied. However, she faces little on-page resistance; we rarely see her under true pressure, and contradictory impulses or blind spots don’t really surface. Her actions align with her motives, but the emotional cost of her choices remains mostly conceptual. The closure reads more like a beautifully framed continuation of an ongoing stance than a pressured internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris’s core motive—to recover her grandmother and understand where deleted memories go—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, especially the decision to enter the heart. Interiority is solid but skewed toward competence and clarity; there’s little on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse around a choice that is, effectively, self-annihilation, which slightly flattens her complexity. The grandmother relationship is poignant but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in specific remembered scenes. The final renunciation of ordinary life feels earned but could land even harder with more visible internal friction in the descent and cutting beats.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The summoner’s vocation, solitude, and ethic of “smoothed hush” are clear and particular, and her actions consistently express those values. However, she experiences little on-page doubt or contradictory impulse about suppressing the buried name—her loneliness and chosen duty are stated more than dramatized under pressure. The final choice reads as an extension of an already-set stance rather than a hard, costly pivot. Strong, coherent, but emotionally somewhat safe.

    Elena’s motives (to normalize her unsettling gift) and Mrs. Kovac’s (to test and recruit her as an heir to Moss’s legacy) are clear and consistent, and the grandmother memory deepens Elena’s internal conflict. The moment when Mrs. Kovac says, “You’re not learning a dead language… You’re remembering one,” lands as an earned reframing rather than a cheap twist. However, the emotional cost of Elena’s final choice is more implied than dramatized—her acceptance feels almost too smooth, with little visible resistance on the page. The relationship dynamic is nicely etched but doesn’t quite hit a crucible-level pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motives are clear and specific—love, fear of cognitive contagion, resistance to state control—and her final refusal is well-earned by her history with her sister. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, especially in how she redefines “crazy” vs. “careful.” The main limitation is that conflicting impulses (desire for recognition vs. terror of control) are largely articulated rather than dramatized in a live push-pull on the page. Still, her endurance/renunciation at the end feels like a true, costly choice rather than a default.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei and the Magistrate are sharply etched, with clear, specific motives—their shared complicity in “calibrated treason” reads as both principled and compromised. Mei’s composure under threat and her analytic calling-out of the Magistrate’s staged negligence make her feel competent yet vulnerable. The Magistrate’s decades-long struggle with inherited reforms grounds his choice to accept ruin as a believable extension of his character. Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened—Mei’s moral tension is more stated than actively tearing at her in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s grief-driven motivation is clear and specific, and her choices (descending, persisting with the shell, deciding to teach others) all track cleanly from that drive. Her interiority feels particular—she’s analytical and sensate rather than generically sad—and her realization about why her sister doesn’t echo is earned by prior setup. The main limitation is that her final decision to become a teacher comes almost frictionlessly once the shell explains the rules, with little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse at the peak. A touch more visible ambivalence or cost at the moment she shifts from mourner to evangelist would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s vocation and methods are sharply defined, and her compassion plus quasi-scientific rigor read as particular rather than generic. Her motivation to mediate between drowned and living is clear and drives each choice. Internal contradiction (e.g., doubt, fear, guilt) is only lightly implied, so her emotional complexity under pressure feels a bit too smooth. Katherine is vivid within limited space, but the relationship remains more functional than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kenji is sharply etched—his profession, habits, and philosophy cohere, and his concern about lost generational knowledge credibly motivates his teaching stance with the apprentice. The girl is thinner but her shame-to-attentiveness shift is believable and grounded in concrete beats (ruined net, watching his hands, asking about the whistling). Internal contradiction is low-key rather than dramatic—Kenji’s “demure audacity” is more a stable trait than a pressured conflict—but his endurance in the face of cultural drift feels like an earned stasis. The final reconfiguration of the girl’s perspective on failure is well motivated by what precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Vera’s professional mindset and skepticism are clear, and her methodical actions track well with her stated motives. The late conflict between debunking and guarding the “miracle” is interesting but underdeveloped on the page, with little dramatized struggle before she decides to obscure the coordinates. Emotional embodiment is light—her “pulse quickened,” but most of her experience stays cerebral. Overall she reads specific and consistent, but not yet deeply conflicted or transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core drives (lonely brilliance, need to prove herself, attraction to “ancient shadows”) are clear and consistent, and her years-long obsession grounds her decision at the end. The interiority is specific—cobalt light on her skin, notebooks of prophetic fragments—rather than generic. However, the peak choice (“I choose the shadows”) comes with minimal on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse, so the cost of that decision feels more stated than dramatized. The loneliness and stubborn wonder are vivid, but her flaws don’t significantly complicate the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cosima’s motivation (to translate between generations, to preserve sounds) is specific and consistently embodied in her choices, from repairing the music box to gifting it away. Her interiority feels particular—“sound was memory made physical”—and her emotional responses are grounded in physical detail (ink-stained fingers, tears as the lullaby plays). The arc from dispossessed vagrant to someone with “purpose salvaged from the wreckage of her fall” is modest but earned. Internal contradiction is relatively muted (she rarely wavers or missteps), which slightly limits depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Meris is clearly motivated by responsibility and professional pride, and her engineer’s mindset is well integrated with her emotional responses (“logically assembling the evidence even as emotion tightened her throat”). Her final choice—to bind the key to her heartbeat—feels earned by prior traits and knowledge. Internal contradiction (temptation of absolution vs duty) is present but only lightly touched; the lure of personal erasure could be more sharply dramatized to deepen her conflict. Crane functions mostly as a lore-bearer rather than an active relational crucible, but his presence still adds generational weight to her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ren’s vocation, family legacy, and desire to transform tradition create a clear, particular psychology, and her “patient revolution” gives her a distinctive inner drive. Her emotions are mostly embodied through the environment (cold, numb fingers, listening to the ice), which fits her temperament. The internal conflict—duty vs. imagination, impatience vs. chosen patience—is present but could sharpen into more live contradiction on the page in at least one moment of actual temptation to rush or rebel. The final stance (enduring and demonstrating rather than declaring) feels motivated by what we’ve seen of her.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena is sharply drawn as a competent, empirically minded investigator under the long shadow of Reeves’s influence, and Malcolm’s personality and struggle emerge convincingly through his notes. Her final choice to defy Reeves and leak evidence is well motivated by prior hints of unease and shared experience of being controlled. Internal conflict (career safety vs truth/justice) is present but could be more acutely dramatized in the moment-to-moment beats rather than mostly implied. Reeves remains effective as an offstage force, though a touch more embodied pressure might deepen the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Characters are clear, specific, and motivated: Marcus’s guilt and Eliana’s professional certainty/regret are cleanly drawn and drive their choices. The reveal of Vittorio’s letter productively reconfigures Eliana’s self-concept. However, her final commitment to months of work comes a bit too smoothly, with limited on-page resistance or contradictory impulse at the decision point. A slightly more dramatized struggle in that moment would deepen the felt cost of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mal’s motivation and temperament are vivid and specific—pioneering, irreverent, and genuinely obsessed with the problem of “teaching a machine to want.” Her choices (building the algorithm, trusting its prediction, setting off toward the bell) follow cleanly from these traits. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost—she moves toward the impossible with little on-page hesitation or competing impulse. The emotional risk of leaving her workshop and relative safety is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena’s professional role, pattern-hunting mind, and quiet obsession are clear and consistent, and her decision to follow the song is motivated by these traits. However, her internal conflict between duty, fear, and longing is under-dramatized; she moves from discovery to acceptance with relatively little on-page struggle. Embodiment of emotion is decent (“hands trembled”) but could use more idiosyncratic texture. The final self-archiving choice feels earned but somewhat too smooth for the scale of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is sharply sketched—seven-year anomaly, shadow-laced, carrying Thomas’s shard—and her burden and ethic are vivid, but her in-scene conflict is mostly solved by the new tool working rather than by dramatized, contradictory impulses under pressure. The link to Thomas (and his burnout) nicely motivates her refusal to see fixed futures, reconfiguring her stance toward the crystal. However, we don’t see her truly tempted to overreach or to walk away; the emotional risk of taking on this new interpretive role is implied rather than dramatized. Secondary characters exist only in glimpses, so her relationships as crucibles remain conceptual rather than on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera is sharply drawn through specific perception and history (the parasol, Warsaw, the surgery) and her motivation—to understand the hum of endings—is clear and consistent. Her internal shift from fear of death to a chosen, difficult attentiveness feels earned by the time she postpones the consultation. The internal conflict between seeking “permission” to let go and choosing to remain present is convincing, though some emotional states are articulated in essayistic abstraction rather than fully embodied. Relationship dynamics with Henriksen are gentle but functional rather than truly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus and Elena are sharply etched with clear history, consistent motives, and believable restraint under pressure; lines like “maintaining the careful distance of people who once knew each other's breathing patterns” feel lived-in. His need to reinterpret their failure and her wary curiosity clash well. The endurance choice at the end—honoring distance rather than rekindling—is credible and carries cost. Some emotional states are stated rather than embodied at peak beats, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Senna’s role, skills, and goal are clear and consistent, and her professional interiority around “line walking” feels specific rather than generic mysticism. However, she experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction under pressure—the piece reads more as competent execution of a known role than a crucible that exposes flaw or cost. Her late realization about the “architecture of pause” is earned but not heavily contested internally. Secondary characters are minimal and apply only light pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margot is distinctive and coherent—“subtle puzzle archivist” with a clear, compassionate project—but her interior conflict stays muted, with little sense of cost or contradiction in her mission. The townspeople come through as types (widow, pensioner, anxious teens) more than fully individuated, though they function well for this length. Her actions (inviting, instructing, archiving) align with her stated belief in reclamation. What’s missing at this echelon is a moment where her own doubt or stake is visibly at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s reticence, fear of speaking, and compulsion to understand the children’s language are all clearly motivated and consistent, and the final decision to testify with a reframed stance feels earned. Her interiority is specific—her relationship to silence, the crystal, and childhood voice gives her a distinct psyche. However, the internal conflict (fear vs duty/curiosity) is thematically rich but not pushed into a truly excruciating choice on the page, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prophet’s motivation—to capture a future sound before he forgets it—is clear, particular, and drives his concrete actions (coming to the garden, arranging driftwood, writing with chalk). His interiority is richly specific and embodied (“creak of joints becoming architecture”), and his curse constrains him in a consistent way. The main limitation is that his internal conflict remains largely textural (longing vs. inevitability) rather than being forced into a sharper, more consequential choice, so the arc feels more like deepened understanding than a pressured change. For top-tier venues, a slightly more legible tension between competing impulses (acceptance vs. refusal, or art vs. relationship) in the moment would strengthen the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kenji is sharply etched through his craft, his grandmother’s teaching, and his response to the tremors; his pivot from resisting the spinning hand to collaborating with it feels motivated and specific. The internal conflict—wanting to fix/stop versus choosing to witness and adapt—is present but relatively gentle rather than sharply torn. Chen is functional as a pressure-applying secondary presence, though she remains more schematic than fully individualized. The final stance (accepting the moon’s leaving and dedicating himself to recording it) is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya and Mr. Chen are both sharply etched, with specific histories (pancake Sundays, surgical precision) that ground their present choices. Mr. Chen’s need for a “flawless goodbye” versus the messiness of his regret reads as a real, character-driven tension. Maya’s “decisively kind” stance is dramatized in how she plays, listens, and redirects him toward authenticity. Rebecca is thinner but serviceable as a pressure point rather than a full co-protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s goal and habits (patient study, rune work, methodical experiment) are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the story. However, she faces little internal conflict or emotional contradiction; her “tremble” is the only hint of deeper fear. The final shift feels more like a clean intellectual success than a choice with personal cost or fraught ambivalence. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet deep enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marianne is sharply drawn as a "forgiving skeptic," with her medical rationality and lingering guilt grounding her reactions to the tooth and Iris; the line about having "buried something that wasn't her daughter" lands as a specific, embodied regret. Her contradictory impulses—to clutch this possible child versus to interrogate the situation—are dramatized rather than told, and her final "Teach me" feels earned by that tension. Iris is more archetypal and expository, functioning as guide more than fully individuated person, which slightly flattens the relationship stakes. Still, Marianne’s inner conflict and micro-choices under pressure read coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is sharply etched: a former astronomer transmuting grief into a ritual of light, with concrete habits (returning each dawn, collecting and polishing glass) that arise credibly from her past. Her motivation is clear and particular—answering her daughter’s old question about stars painting the ground—without lapsing into therapy-speak. The main limitation is that internal contradiction under live pressure is muted; she feels more like someone already settled into a redemptive pattern than a person still being tested by it. The ending endurance is moving but low-friction, so the cost of her chosen stasis stays somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s interiority is specific and coherent, with the “watchful dreamer” flaw credibly evolving into a more active stance, and her embodied reactions (tensing, touching the pendant, the shift in her tears) feel lived. The relationship with Jenna, via Dr. Chen, becomes a believable crucible despite Jenna’s absence. Contradictory impulses—defensiveness vs. willingness to stay and engage—are present, though they could be pushed even harder at the moment Chen appears. The final choice to invite Chen deeper into the “cathedral” is well earned by prior setup and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The novelist’s block, ethical scruple about “which truth to solemnize,” and eventual reframing around “the shape of hope” create a coherent, specific interior arc. Her watchfulness, the way each apparition lands in her body (“settled into her chest like a stone,” “throat tightened”), and the decision to carry memory forward rather than choose mercy or vengeance all feel earned. The internal contradiction—wanting an ending yet distrusting endings—is present throughout, even if it remains mostly contemplative rather than under acute external pressure. The final stance reads as an earned renunciation/endurance choice with a clear cost: choosing the harder path of remembering.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cassian’s motivation—honoring his grandmother and restoring land-healing rituals—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his years of study and the construction/operation of the machine. Interiority is present but relatively simple: he is devoted and earnest, with little on-page contradictory impulse or doubt to complicate him. His weeping as the machine works and his final understanding about “faith” feel earned, but they do not arise from a hard-fought internal conflict. Relationships (with the grandmother, with the village) are mostly summarized rather than put under present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s motivation—to translate the orchard’s fading “heartbeats” into maps of longing—is clear, specific, and organically tied to her behavior and history with the observatory logbook. Her patience and care are embodied in her ritualistic movements and long hours of stillness, not just told. The piece lacks much on-page contradiction or internal conflict, so her emotional arc is more steady devotion than contested change, but for this quiet mode it feels earned. The final act of sealing the maps in the tree reads as a credible, character-driven culmination of that devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is clearly motivated—his locksmith background and obsessive curiosity plausibly drive every choice, and his focus on “storing wonder” gives him a distinct inner vector. However, internal contradiction is only lightly implied (wonder vs. survival pragmatism) and never put under real pressure in scene. Emotional texture is more conceptual than embodied; we rarely feel his exhaustion, fear, or doubt in the body. The final stance is earned but relatively low-cost, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fractal weaver’s motives (compulsion to understand the patterns, inherited connection to mining grief via the lamp) are clear and consistent, and her final reconfiguration into “the trap itself” feels earned. Her emotional texture is specific and embodied through actions like cradling the burdens and staying three seasons. Internal contradiction (desire for escape vs. inability to stop weaving until she understands) is present but could be dramatized through sharper on-page moments of resistance or failure, rather than mostly being stated. Relationships are all off-page, so the piece leans entirely on her solitary interiority, which it mostly sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Margot’s motivation—to complete Roland’s long-delayed carving as a way of metabolizing grief—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized. Her contradictory impulses (practical vs. memorial vs. ineffable object) are present in her deliberation about what to carve. Interiority is concrete and filtered through sensory work with the wood and rain, not abstract labels. The final stance—accepting an imperfect, useful bowl—feels like an earned renunciation of preserving Roland’s “perfect” unrealized vision.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific: her collecting of fragments, sense of erosion, and ambivalent desire to leave versus stay all feel grounded. The final choice to take the ghost’s hand is emotionally earned by the earlier depiction of her paralysis and regret. The contradiction between her past resoluteness and present dissociation is clear and pays off at the end. A slight distance—her history and concrete prior self remain somewhat abstract—keeps this just short of fully devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s curiosity and engineer’s mindset are clearly dramatized in how she reads water stains, studies blueprints, and extrapolates new uses from decay. Her motivation to reimagine rather than demolish is consistent and plausible, and the final choice to send the proposal is earned. Internal contradiction (job obligation vs speculative hope) is present but under-pressured, with the cost of defiance mostly conceptual rather than sharply felt. Added embodied emotion or specific fear around the consequences of defying the demolition brief could deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scribe’s fear, regret, and latent ambition are clearly dramatized through specific memories and embodied reactions (shaking hands, the weight of the satchel). Her final choice to resign and start over at thirty-seven is credibly earned from those pressures and feels like a real renunciation of safety. Internal contradiction—duty vs. desire, fear vs. longing—is present, though the emotional resolution comes a bit smoothly and tidily. A touch more mess or lingering doubt at the end would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation as a driven, disappointed seeker is clear and consistent, and her choice to trust the “unreasonable” and use the sundial feels rooted in that history. Interiority is specific enough (years of failure, training intuition) to individualize her beyond trope. However, the internal conflict is muted: once the phenomenon begins, she accepts the revelation with little resistance or contradictory impulse. The final shift is believable but emotionally smooth, with limited visible cost beyond summarized past effort.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is vividly drawn as an observant, patient, almost devotional figure whose motives (preservation of encoded knowledge) are coherent and specific, and whose choices (decoding, documenting, then re-sealing the rope) align with that worldview. Her interiority is filtered through concrete attentions—seeds, knots, fulgurite—rather than abstract labels. The main limitation is a lack of on-page contradiction or internal struggle; she encounters no serious pressure that forces her values into conflict. The final stance feels like an intensification of what she already is rather than a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren and the Duchess both feel specific, with clear motives and embodied emotion—the Duchess’s “geographical exile” and her unmarked palms are especially sharp. The relationship dynamic is well-drawn: Maren as a practiced, almost clinical empath, the Duchess brittle and self-justifying until the key challenge. Internal contradiction (the Duchess tending roses she won’t touch, explaining absences while longing to return) is present but could be heightened under direct pressure. The emotional shift from control to breakdown reads earned, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cael’s motivation (reawakening beauty in a mechanized world) is clear and consistent, and his acceptance of a hybrid, “imperfect” phoenix feels earned by the end. Interiority is specific—his “quaking reverie” with the palace and his ambivalence about technology ground him as more than a stock prince. Vashira’s pragmatism and conflicted tenderness add a credible relational crucible without stealing focus. The main limitation is that Cael rarely faces a sharply dramatized *choice* under pressure; the internal conflict is rich but not strongly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya is sharply drawn—firefighter, arsonist’s daughter, ritual leader—and her shame/compassion dynamic feels specific and earned, with clear motivation driving every choice in the scene. Elena’s guardedness and gradual softening track believably, and the relationship between them is the crucible where the story turns. The main weakness is that at peak beats their speech sometimes drifts toward authorial thesis (“refusing to let flame write the final verse”) rather than being fully character-particular. Still, the emotional progression and final shift in Elena read credible and paid-for.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply drawn as a “luminous skeptic,” and her interior tug-of-war between rationalism and wonder feels specific and consistent with her profession-minded, empiricist cast of thought. Her choices—to follow rumors, read the constellation, and risk opening the box—are all legible extensions of that temperament. The main weakness is the relatively low felt cost: her doubt evolves smoothly into acceptance without much genuine risk or consequence on the page. More embodied emotional dissonance at the moment of opening would push this toward truly top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Keeper, the mother, and the daughter are cleanly sketched with clear, legible motives—parental sacrifice, curiosity, and cosmic caretaking. The mother’s mix of fear and desperate hope is effective, and the Keeper’s sentimentality reads through action as well as narration. However, interior contradiction and real micro-conflict are only lightly explored; the mother’s emotional journey from distrust to acceptance happens quickly and without much mess. The Keeper’s vast history doesn’t noticeably complicate their present choice, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully three-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The carver’s motivation and interior life are specific, coherent, and tied to her craft and family history, and Marcus’s presence is cleanly motivated by her unresolved grief. Her arc from treating deaths as isolated to seeing grief as continuous feels earned through the ribbon and their shared past. The relationship dynamic—mentor/peer/relative—has warmth and gentle pressure, though the emotional shift happens a bit smoothly with limited visible resistance. A touch more embodied conflict (hesitation, pushback) in the middle would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s guilt, routines, and “ethical diligence” create a clear, specific interior life, and her choice to stop and then re-start the clock with her brother’s name etched into its heart is well-motivated. The long-term cowardice vs present courage tension feels credible. However, her conflict is more linear than contradictory in the moment—she doesn’t visibly waver once she starts engraving the bob—which slightly flattens peak-beat complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marta’s interiority is specific and coherent: the blithe attitude toward death, the chess-player’s pattern-obsession, and her inheritance of the grandmother’s work all line up to motivate her decoding drive. The chess loss as a catalyst for rethinking “intention” is elegant and character-true. Internal conflict is relatively soft—she doesn’t truly resist or fear what she’s uncovering—so the final commitment carries more conceptual than emotional cost. Still, the shift from casual groundskeeper to self-appointed archivist of truth reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s core motivation is clear and specific—she wants to “seed innovation within a constraint” by writing a future that counters human blindness—and her professional worldview feels coherent. However, she moves through the piece with very little friction or contradiction; the models correct her, but we don’t see her genuinely torn or forced into a painful trade-off. Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied; her hand cramps, but there’s little sense of real fear, doubt, or cost. The final stance (she has written the document and is hopeful) feels earned but low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically tied to her work and the famine, and her micro-choices (tuning to static, switching from notation to lyrics, deciding to disseminate the method) feel consistent and grounded. However, her inner life remains relatively unconflicted—there’s little sense of fear, doubt, or competing impulses as she discovers something momentous. Emotional embodiment is mostly channeled through setting rather than through contradictions or messy feeling in her interiority. The final “calling” realization is earned but arrives without much visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s inner life and professional identity are vivid and particular, and her final shift in how she understands and performs her work feels earned. Motivation is mostly conceptual (relationship to safety, preservation, omission) but grounded in concrete ritual (cremating portraits, scattering ash). The main limitation is that we see little contradictory impulse in the moment—she moves fairly smoothly from comfort to recognition rather than struggling between competing drives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is sharply sketched—a self-exiled rationalist whose choices (saving the library, rejecting surface narratives, then conceding to Karin’s plan) consistently track his beliefs. His interiority is particular (the chronometer cog, layers of civilization), and Karin’s motives feel grounded in her academic history. However, the piece is idea-forward, so conflicting impulses (loneliness vs. purity, fear vs. duty) are more implied than actively dramatized, which slightly blunts the emotional cost of his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mrs. Chen is sharply etched—her history, values, and quiet stubbornness all feel specific and embodied, especially in details like “traveled stillness” and her handling of the rosette. Her motivation to remake community through listening is clear and consistent with her past as a choir teacher. However, internal contradiction under pressure is more implied than dramatized; we’re told she’s “expectantly resigned,” but we don’t see a live internal struggle between resignation and hope in the present scene. The secondary characters are more symbolic than individuated, which slightly flattens relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motives are clear and specific—professional disillusionment plus inherited rebellion—and her choices (planting, eating, then sharing the fruit) track cleanly from them. The occupational detail of tasting memories in food gives her interiority a distinctive slant. However, we rarely see contradictory impulses in-scene; once she commits, there’s little visible doubt or cost, so the arc feels a touch frictionless. The late interaction with the girl is affecting but doesn’t substantially reconfigure Mara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s involuntary honesty is a strong, defining flaw that cleanly motivates why Chen chose her and what she’ll do next, and Chen’s guilt and need to atone feel grounded. Their dynamic—his burdened idealism against her pragmatic candor—plays well in dialogue. However, Mira’s internal conflict remains somewhat abstract; we’re told she’ll have to report him but don’t feel a live, torn decision in the moment. The ending leans on conceptual realization more than dramatized emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is specific, consistent, and her motive—to understand why some houses feel alive—organically drives her collecting and altar-making. Her “creeping normality” perception is dramatized in concrete observations, not just labels. Internal conflict is relatively soft (she’s not deeply torn so much as seeking), so the final reframing of her “gift” feels earned but low-cost. A touch more contradiction under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and specific—her anger, shock, and ethical weighing of revelation vs. comfort feel credible under time pressure. The statue’s incisive kindness and long-term burden read as distinct character traits that shape its choices, especially in waiting centuries for “someone ready to welcome nuance.” The micro-choice around the ampoule and the decision to “tell them everything” are well earned by prior interiority. A minor limit is that Marina’s embodied emotion could be pushed one notch deeper or more particular to distinguish her further from a generic conscientious diver.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s conflict between safety and risk is sharply drawn and motivates every beat, from her flight into teaching to her final decision to email Castellano. Interiority is specific (the “confession of cowardice” in her lectures, the remembered proofs as “musical notation”) and her flaw—risk only when hedged—is clear and active. The relationship with Castellano carries lived history and pressure rather than serving as a mere exposition mouthpiece. The only slight limitation is how cleanly she articulates her own conflict; her self-understanding verges on tidy insight rather than showing more irrational edge under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied—from “methodically hopeful” insomnia to the way she uses ritual to survive exhaustion—and her motive to prove that kindness persists is clear and consistent. Her actions (choosing to paint through the night, stopping only once she feels she’s proven her thesis) align cleanly with that motive. The quiet shift from driven wakefulness to finally relinquishing control to sleep reads as an earned stasis with a felt cost (72 hours awake). The only limit is that her internal conflict stays relatively unfrayed; we rarely see truly contradictory impulses in live tension.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste is sharply etched: her curatorial mindset, displacement, and commitment to preservation drive every choice, from the lens to the bread. Her emotional life is implied more than dramatized in-scene, so internal contradiction under pressure stays relatively soft. Secondary figures are ghosts more than characters, but that’s appropriate to the piece’s focus. The final stance—turning museum skills toward survival—is well earned by prior traits.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motivation—to defy linear time and fate—is clear, specific, and grounded in concrete habits (backward clocks, obsessive tinkering). Her interiority is vivid but skewed toward determination rather than contradiction; we see little competing desire (e.g., fear, attachment to the world she may lose). The final step into the radiance feels earned by prior obsession, with a believable cost in leaving her world and work behind. A touch more on what she risks emotionally (any ties, doubts) would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Margot’s fear, curse, and drive to understand “what fear wants” give her a clear, specific interior life, and her choice to weaponize the clasp feels earned by prior beats. Her emotional experience is embodied through sensory overload in the funhouse rather than abstract labels. The advisor is sketch-like but effective as an externalization of temptation and knowledge. Complexity is modest—her contradictions (terror yet compulsion to probe it) are present but could be sharpened further under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren’s competence, history, and vocation are sharply drawn, and her methods feel idiosyncratic rather than generic “seer” shorthand. Her attachment to the mallet and the trees grounds her emotionally, but we don’t see much genuine doubt or contradictory impulse under pressure—she’s almost serenely correct throughout. The brief friction with Deren registers but doesn’t cut very deep into either of them. The final choice feels fully motivated but carries little visible psychic cost beyond focused exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivation (refusal to accept the city’s complacency and need to understand the watchers/turtles) is clear, consistent, and drives each choice. Her “quiet drive” is shown through obsessive measuring, returning to the forbidden edge, and persisting despite the Council’s dismissal. Internal emotion is embodied (ink-stained fingers, dread as “shadow-water”) rather than labeled. The only limit is that we see little active internal contradiction under pressure—her resolve is strong but not much tested against competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motivation is clear, consistent, and anchored in her profession and values; her calm, reasoned persistence in the face of Hawthorne’s objections feels credible. The dynamic between her and Hawthorne carries legible status and generational tension, with his guardianship versus her scholarly transparency. However, interior contradiction is underplayed—she is almost too smoothly “emotionally rational,” with little felt conflict about possible fallout or self-doubt. A sharper moment of ambivalence or fear as she commits to publication would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus is sharply drawn: the professional surveyor whose real, secret vocation is memorializing the forgotten, with clear motives that align with every choice. His stoic exterior versus intense inner response (“each measurement pierced him”) feels specific rather than generic. The discovery of the box and his decision to leave those letters undisturbed deepen his characterization without breaking his established pattern. The only minor limit is that his internal conflict is more implied than dramatized in a live dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s professional mindset and ethical drive are specific and consistent, and her curiosity under pressure feels believable. Her motivation to “trace honest origins” clearly informs every choice. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper internal contradiction or visible cost—her arc is more reaffirmation than transformation. The emotions are well sketched but remain relatively low-stakes and cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mei’s grief-driven motivation is precise and consistent, and her craftiness (bribing a priest, inventing crane-gems) makes her active rather than purely mournful. The occupational detail of lantern-making and dream-gem work grounds her psychology in specific behaviors. Internal contradiction is present but muted—she suffers under the beauty she creates yet never seriously questions her project, so the emotional palette is a bit narrow. Still, her final recommitment to the work reads as an earned endurance with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s grief, scientific obsession, and survivor’s guilt are specific and coherent, and details like the geode gift and her sensor modifications root her motivation in concrete history. However, she faces little on-page dilemma or contradictory impulse in the present; most conflict is pre-decided (she’s already committed to the hunt). Interiority is textured and embodied (“palm against the frost-rimed window,” the memory of her cousin’s laughter) rather than generic. The relationship with Dr. Vahedi is sketched but not heavily stressed, functioning more as validation than as a crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is sharply and economically drawn—her neural interface, isolation, “perpetually surprised” face, and niche expertise all feel specific and coherent. Her core motivation (a lifelong search for belonging) is clear and credibly reframed by the pilgrim’s proposition. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction; she accepts the mission with little resistance or cost beyond implied risk, so contradictory impulses under pressure never fully ignite. The pilgrim is more a thematic mouthpiece than a pressuring personality, keeping the relational crucible shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s guilt, professional skill, and moral compromise are sharply drawn, with concrete history (Elias, the Thornhills) grounding her current torment. Her internal conflict between silence and confession is credible and persists to the end, where her decision to dismantle her fabrications feels earned. Elias is sketched efficiently with enough nuance (his own tempered regret) to avoid him reading as a pure accuser. The main limitation is that their climactic interaction resolves a bit quickly given the scale of harm.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Katrin is clearly defined by role, burden, and method, with a believable professional competence and a humane core, but her inner contradictions under pressure remain mostly gestured at rather than dramatized. Her motivation to “recycle mistakes into wisdom” is credible and consistent with her choices. Secondary characters are functional types rather than people, but that suits the tight focus. The final exhale and return to calculation read as an earned stasis rather than a deep internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina is sharply rendered: her guilt, muscle-memory competence, and superstition around the compass all cohere into motivated choices, especially the pivot from refusal to “I’ll use everything.” The backstory of the wreck is efficiently tied to present stakes, and her internal contradiction—hyper-competent yet paralyzed—is active on the page. Amy is slightly less textured but still credible, and the bond between them feels earned rather than convenient. The final choice to guide again reads as a costly, believable evolution rather than a clean cure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motivation—terror of who he was and desire not to repeat it—is clear and coherent with the memory-erasure premise, and his decision “I choose to try” is earned by the prior setup. However, his interiority leans on summary (“He needed answers…”) instead of dramatizing sharper contradictory impulses under pressure. The Interpreter has a distinct voice and status dynamic with him, but she risks archetype more than individual person. Emotional embodiment is present but could be more specific and less abstract in the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s motivation (regain her brother at the cost of her humanity) is clear, consistent, and escalates credibly into the final choice. Her fear and love coexist on the page (“The metamorphosis would be reluctant…she knew what it meant”), giving her interiority real tension. Tam functions well as a relational crucible, pressing the cost (“you won’t be my sister anymore”) just before she commits. A slightly deeper articulation of what being human means to her, beyond the bond, could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cartomancer’s guilt, professional pride, and maternal love are all legible and in tension, and the final renunciation reads as a credible consequence of what she sees in the cards. Embodied details—trembling fingers, the tablecloth history, the choking beauty—ground her interiority. The main weakness is that once the third card’s vision lands, the pivot toward change feels a bit swift and morally clean, with little residue of ongoing ambivalence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mei’s motivation and interiority are specific and consistent—her vocation, obsession with the Tear, and extinction-aware drive all ring true, and the joy/mass trait is nicely embodied in how she moves. Akio functions as a clear relational crucible, his pacifism pressing on her choice even as he softens. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of internal contradiction in Mei at the climax; she rarely wavers, so the choice to proceed feels less conflicted than the premise allows. The cost of “facing the shadow” is more conceptual than personally dramatized in her body or psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and specific: ex-heiress turned destitute wanderer with a compulsive generosity and emerging prophetic intuition, and her interior drive (“to understand…texture”) is coherent. Her actions (taking the detour, guiding the surveyor, releasing the jars) align with and reveal that character under pressure. Internal conflict is present but gently handled—she’s between identities more than actively torn—so the final self-definition feels earned but not harrowed. The surveyor functions mainly as a foil, but the brief interaction still underscores her role as orchestrator.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is clearly motivated, competent, and consistent, with her lock-sentinel skills, long-term subterfuge, and calm in the blackout all aligning. However, internal conflict is minimal—she never wavers or pays a visible emotional price for treason, which flattens complexity at the key turn. The relationship with Voss has a nice status dynamic and implied shared risk, but it’s sketched rather than pressured. The final “smallest smile” suggests a shift from vigilance to revolutionary poise, yet the cost of that shift is only abstractly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Korin’s motivation (to decode the pattern tied to her grandmother’s promise and the loss of friction) is clear and consistent, and her eel-herder competence feels specific. However, her internal life skews conceptual; we get very little contradiction or genuine struggle beyond trembling hands, so the final acceptance/understanding doesn’t feel hard-won. The “curse” is interesting but mostly functions as a convenient clarity tool rather than a source of fraught missteps. The cost of her choice (accepting the universe’s letting-go) is more thematic than personally torn.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is textured and specific: persecuted, disciplined, both “angry and still,” with clear values expressed through the ritualized timer and the underground distribution. Her motivation to keep witnessing despite being branded “UNRELIABLE” is consistent and embodied in concrete habits. The internal contradiction between woundedness and determination is well dramatized rather than merely stated. The only slight limitation is that all pressure is internal/situational; no relationship on the page sharpens or complicates her choices in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Adelaine is sharply etched—her mechanical arm, history of bloody debates, and uncompromising intellect all align with her choice to prioritize decoding over dueling. Harwick has enough complexity (wounded pride but genuine curiosity) to feel more than a stock opponent. The relationship shifts credibly from antagonism to grudging respect through shared problem-solving. What’s missing for a higher score is deeper, on-page contradiction or vulnerability in Adelaine under pressure; she never feels truly internally split.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara and Kai feel specific and lived-in, with clear, consistent motives—her compulsion to “forge beauty from anarchy” and his page-by-page rebuilding map cleanly to what they do in the scene. The molting personalities give her interiority a distinctive texture and a real cost via forgetting. Relationship history is efficiently evoked through the prison-library backstory and their banter. The main limitation is that their present-tense emotional conflict stays relatively low-pressure, so contradictory impulses aren’t pushed as hard as they could be.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pianist is clearly motivated by long-term grief and longing, and her nightly ritual with the broken clock nicely externalizes that internal state. Her choice to act “strategically creative” in the present is well grounded in prior behavior (her familiarity with the projector and films). However, her interiority is somewhat one-note—she’s wistful and desperate but rarely conflicted or self-contradictory on the page. The reunion lands emotionally but would gain power if we’d seen sharper ambivalence or fear about what success might cost her.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kima’s vocation, skepticism, and longing are well realized, and her central dilemma feels organic to her role as “reality checker.” The push-pull between duty and desire is shown both in dreams and dialogue, with Prem providing a credible relational crucible. Her final decision to plant the seed is motivated and forecloses an alternate path. A slight over-tidiness in articulating her realization (“truth and wish aren't always opposites”) keeps this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s core motivation (to understand her grandmother and the family severance) is clear and consistent, and her shift from “find what was lost” to “tend what remains” feels earned. However, her interiority leans more toward graceful summary than fully embodied contradiction under pressure; we see little of her resisting or misreading what she learns. Takeo is a compelling, specific archetype (the slow, bonsai-focused tutor), but he functions more as thematic conduit than as a character under his own pressure. The relationship dynamic is gentle and asymmetrical, which suits the piece but keeps the crucible fairly cool.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Characterization is exemplary, fusing professional expertise with private grief to drive a unique worldview. The "preprocessing" attribute is dramatized through the specific action of creating an "island of order" amidst chaos. The internal shift from resistance to humility is earned via the tactile work of the scene rather than mere introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vera's motivation is clear, but her agency dissolves at the climax; she overcomes an armed man with a speech about glass, and his surrender happens off-page. The resolution relies on the antagonist's passive compliance rather than a dramatized, earned victory or trade-off driven by the protagonist's specific skills.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s internal state is clearly defined, but her journey is presented through summary rather than a specific, pressure-filled scene where she must make difficult choices. The character arc relies on a passive acceptance of the healing process—success is narrated ("Visitors entered," "People came") rather than earned through a dramatized struggle against resistance or failure in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marcel serves as a functional vessel for the premise rather than a fully realized character; his motivation is clear, but his journey lacks internal conflict or costly choices. The realization that death is a "relocation" provides a nice framing, but his acceptance of the supernatural task is immediate and frictionless, offering little resistance to drive character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation is consistent, but her pivotal shift from secrecy to revelation is summarized ("she realized") rather than dramatized through a specific pressure beat. The internal struggle is told rather than shown, distancing the reader from the risk of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on labeled emotional summary ("desperate love," "unresolved attachment") rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. The character functions largely as a vessel for the concept, lacking distinct agency beyond the prompt's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s internal shift from resisting her condition to accepting the "recursive existence" is compelling and well-motivated. However, the exposition of her "retrocognitive" state via a memory of "physicians" feels slightly explanatory rather than dramatized in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira functions more as a thematic archetype than a psychological entity; she lacks internal friction, doubt, or contradictory impulses even during the escape. Her competence is absolute, making her trajectory feel idealized rather than earned through genuine struggle or character-specific flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira is a compelling focalizer whose internal contradiction—the desire to engineer a cure for an emotional absence—drives the narrative. Her choice to destroy the matrix acts as a profound renunciation, earned by the visceral "unbearability" of the sound she discovers. The synthesis of her professional competence and maternal grief creates a specific, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Maya functions more as a vessel for the prompt's concept than a fully realized character; her internal state is described through abstract labels ("luminous disbelief") rather than embodied reaction. The transition from thief to artist feels smooth and inevitable rather than a struggle between conflicting desires. Her motivation is explicitly stated in dialogue rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on the "narrating to no one" device, which externalizes interiority in a performative way ("Observe how the flame kisses glass") rather than grounding it in organic thought. While the motivation to reconcile is clear, the protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living person, with self-analysis that feels diagnostic ("recognizing his own metaphor") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maya is a functional protagonist, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("claustrophobia," "adaptive survival instincts") rather than dramatized experience. The connection between her backstory and the present crisis is stated explicitly rather than felt through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Oracle and Commander function well as archetypes within this fable-like structure. However, the Oracle's defining trait ("mildly obsessed with endings") is delivered via exposition rather than dramatized through resistance or difficult choices. The interaction remains professional and distant, lacking the visceral, contradictory interiority required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    J-7's interiority is well-rendered, particularly the sensory transition from cold to warmth. However, his epiphany relies heavily on the doctor's guidance rather than emerging solely from his own struggle, softening the emotional impact of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s internal state is well-rendered, moving from passive observer to active participant. Dmitri is viewed largely through Mira’s projection, but his fear is dramatized effectively via the voiceover. The transition from observer to actor is motivated, though the specific logic of the doodle-decoding relies slightly on a convenient realization rather than deep character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Vine Dresser creates a compelling counter-weight to Marcus's anxiety, her authority earned through the specific, tactile history of the marbles. Her internal strength is dramatized through the "mended deception" ritual rather than mere exposition. The dynamic effectively highlights the contrast between external metrics and internal cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael is competent and distinct, but the characterization lacks internal friction. The "obliging" trait is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult choice; Kael acts with authority throughout, never having to overcome a genuine internal weakness or contradictory impulse to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    Professional credibility is shattered by the protagonist submerging a wooden cello in floodwater; a musician would know this destroys the instrument instantly, yet no cost is acknowledged. Motivation is vague ("inspired by something she couldn't name") and agency is minimal as the ghost literally spells out the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but her internal struggle relies heavily on abstract summaries ("grief and hope intermingled") rather than dramatized, embodied emotion. The connection between the fever dreams and the code solution feels convenient, bypassing the intellectual labor of the problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.7)
    Marcus functions as a passive observer defined by prompt labels ("religiously skeptical") rather than dramatized choice. His skepticism is stated but immediately discarded as he accepts the supernatural without the struggle or internal conflict that would give the trait weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype with motivation established in summary ("shifted over the countless seasons") rather than through dramatized choices. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("regenerative silence") rather than specific, embodied struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her internal landscape lacks the friction of contradictory impulses; she functions more as a benevolent archetype than a flawed individual. The client’s breakthrough feels smoothed over, lacking the resistance or behavioral setbacks that would make the resolution feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Miren functions as a passive observer rather than an active agent; her primary actions are sorting and intuiting. She faces no internal contradiction, hard choice, or meaningful struggle, making her role static. The "sensitive perception" reads as a convenient superpower rather than a dramatized trait tested by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya is portrayed as hyper-competent, executing her task without hesitation, error, or internal contradiction, which drains tension. Her motivation is delivered through expository backstory blocks ("motivation had crystallized years ago") rather than dramatized through an on-page struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Father Calloway is a distinct, competent figure with a unique methodological approach, but he remains static throughout the crisis. He enters as an expert and leaves as a victor without facing internal contradiction, doubt, or personal cost, which limits emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Characterization is internally consistent, with a clear emotional trajectory from hollowness to purpose. The protagonist's specific malaise ("chronological homesickness") is a strong hook, though the resolution relies on a somewhat swift epiphany rather than a high-cost struggle. The emotional shift feels earned by the setting and memory, if slightly convenient in its speed.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is legible, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("built from her own cowardice") rather than dramatized experience. The resolution occurs via a summarized list of corrected past choices rather than a specific, high-pressure decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    Oskar is distinct, but his emotional arc is summarized rather than dramatized through friction. The resolution of his "numbness" feels unearned because he encounters no psychological resistance or setbacks in applying his method.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marianne is a coherent, competent protagonist whose obsession anchors the narrative. However, her acceptance of the stranger's mission is frictionless; she transitions from solitary skeptic to recruit without significant internal struggle or resistance, which lowers the dramatic weight of her choice. The trait "credibly curious" is delivered as a narrator label rather than dramatized through a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s unique profession as a lantern broker perfectly complements her role in the climax, turning a sensory deficit into a moment of expert perception. Her internal struggle with the vial is poignant and well-motivated, grounding the sci-fi premise in genuine human loss.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marcus is a clearly defined observer with a distinct worldview, but he lacks active struggle or internal contradiction. His journey is smooth and contemplative, functioning more as a camera for the theme than a protagonist making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maya is a competent focalizer with distinct acoustic perception, but she lacks significant internal contradiction or flaws; her path from intuition to validation is smooth and linear. The family members serve primarily as witnesses to her action rather than sources of interpersonal friction, resulting in a somewhat static emotional dynamic despite the grief.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist whose professional cynicism conflicts beautifully with her sensory intuition. The internal struggle between valuing "worthless" authenticity and creating "perfect" counterfeits is dramatized in the final micro-choice to flaw her own creation. Her arc from detachment to a nuanced empathy is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marianne is defined by labels ("shrewd," "cautious exuberance") that dissolve instantly upon meeting Chen, leaving her without the internal friction required for a compelling arc. Her transformation is linear and frictionless; she moves from curiosity to fulfillment without a moment of doubt, contradiction, or sacrifice. The emotional shift is asserted through summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's desire for belonging is clear and drives the narrative, but the disconnect between her internal experience during the search (feigning ignorance) and the reveal undermines emotional authenticity. The story treats her deception as a surprise for the reader rather than a complex character choice, leaving her interiority feeling curated rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vera is a competent protagonist with clear motivation, but her internal arc is static. The central choice—to uncage the echo—is driven by professional integrity but faces no genuine opposition or personal cost, resulting in a low-stakes progression where success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s internal arc from desperate searching to acceptance is distinct and drives the ritualistic action effectively. However, the interiority occasionally leans into abstract thematic summaries ("grief no equation could solve") rather than consistently embodied emotion, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    Miriam is a coherent protagonist with a clear desire, but her arc is linear and lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. Her journey from invisibility to purposeful connection feels somewhat idealized, as she faces no significant temptation to keep the tapes or genuine fear of discovery that would complicate her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s internal landscape is rendered with precision, and the tension between her academic past and her nursery present is consistent. However, the character arc relies heavily on retrospective summary rather than an active, unfolding struggle in the present moment. The "metamorphosis" feels largely completed before the scene begins, reducing the vitality of her on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation to "thresh meaning" is clearly dramatized and drives the central action. The shift from insomnia as a curse to a vigil of communion is a satisfying internal arc, though the epiphany ("It was memory") feels slightly rushed in its clarity, resolving the internal conflict with high precision but lower emotional struggle than expected.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s transformation from an all-knowing oracle to a "wonderer" is a profound internal shift earned by the specific sensory breakdown of her environment. The cost of this change—the loss of her legendary gift—is visceral and paid clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marina functions effectively as a thematic vessel, but her internal landscape is largely summarized rather than dramatized through pressure. The "reactive vision" trait is explained in exposition rather than shown through a difficult choice, and her interaction with Thomas lacks friction or contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority often relies on summary labels ("analytical mind," "artistic eye") rather than embodied reaction. The "crucible" with the conductor is resolved quickly with a declaration ("I dare") rather than a struggle that reveals deep internal contradiction or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for the magical experience rather than driving the scene through active, difficult choices. The defining trait ("courageously kind") is delivered via retrospective exposition/diagnostic labeling during the peak moment rather than being dramatized through a specific present-tense action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Naia’s agency drives the scene effectively, contrasting well with Cassius’s established ennui. However, Cassius’s internal state relies heavily on the "bored immortal" trope without fresh particularity until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation is distinctly drawn and drives the plot, centering on her need for balance and truth. However, her dialogue articulates her internal "mathematics" theme too explicitly ("honesty was its own kind of mathematics"), which feels like expository labeling rather than natural speech under pressure. Vincent’s rapid emotional collapse is functional but feels slightly rushed given the short runway.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stationer is a distinct, consistent focalizer whose motivation ("collecting textures") drives every beat. Her interiority is intellectual but grounded in the physical action of the climb, and the final choice—to embrace "beautiful untruths" over objective fact—is a earned stance crystallization that gives the character arc definitive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s internal landscape is rendered with precision, moving from resigned erasure to active reclamation without losing the melancholic texture of the character. The decision to hand over the notebook is a strong beat of agency that signals a shift in her survival strategy, earning the resolution. The shared name dynamic is handled with emotional intelligence rather than just plot utility.

    Mira functions effectively as a focalizer for the skepticism-to-belief arc, but her professional identity ("myth buster") feels more like a label than a lived reality, as she abandons her methodology immediately upon encountering the phenomenon. The grandmother exists primarily as a dispenser of wisdom rather than a fully realized character, and the emotional resolution—a swift acceptance of the "magic"—smooths over the internal conflict of a fifteen-year career in skepticism too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marina is clearly motivated and her internal conflict (dual allegiance) is well-defined. However, her pivotal decision to "reorganize everything" occurs in narrative summary rather than as a dramatized micro-choice under pressure, which distances the reader from her agency at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen’s motivation—to preserve the ephemeral—is compelling and sustains the narrative arc. The transition from observer to witness is clear, though the pivotal realization relies on an external prop's inscription rather than purely internal pressure or struggle. The emotional embodiment is generally strong, anchoring the scientific context in human loss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mara acts as an idealized, hyper-competent figure who faces no internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Her blindness is treated as a superpower rather than a constraint that extracts a price, and her "heartfelt" nature is asserted via exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices. While her motivation is clear, the lack of a flaw or internal conflict results in a static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is consistent but defined by labels ("dry wit," "subtly confident") rather than demonstrated action; the "wit" is a mild correction, not wit. Motivation is clear, but the lack of internal doubt or interpersonal friction leaves the character functioning as a plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype without interiority, contradictory impulses, or personal cost; she operates as a magical device rather than a character under pressure. The townsfolk serve as a chorus with no individual agency or resistance, resulting in a cast that lacks psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara shows clear competence and agency, prioritizing duty over the seductive pull of the vial. Her internal struggle is brief but legible; however, the dialogue where she explicitly articulates her method ("By overriding instinct") feels like a forced prompt insertion rather than organic character voice during a hypoxia crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Matthias is clearly defined by his burden of legacy ("lineage of liars"), and this internal conflict drives his interaction with the environment. The shift from skeptic to participant is rapid but earned through the revelation of the prisoners' state and the external pressure of the searchers. His final choice to "thread the labyrinth" is a credible decisive change that resolves his identity crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.8)
    Marcus acts as a passive vehicle for the plot, arriving, listening to an exposition dump, and immediately obeying instructions without internal struggle. The climax relies on him offering "forgiveness," but this emotional shift is unearned; he has no personal relationship to the grievance, making the gesture mechanical rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions as a devoted archetype rather than a conflicted individual; she lacks internal contradiction or flaws that make choices difficult. The "sleeping intelligence" mechanic removes conscious agency from the central task, as her body solves the maze while her mind is absent, reducing the friction of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's internal arc is largely summarized rather than dramatized. The pivotal shift ("The work changed her") is stated diagnostically rather than shown through a specific high-pressure choice or realization in scene. The emotional stakes ("hollow weight") feel generic and resolved too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Iris's profession as a pseudonym creator creates a distinct worldview where she sees codes in innocence, deeply informing her internal conflict. The decision to reclaim her name is a strong, earned renunciation of her safety that follows logically from her character design. The connection to the shelter children adds texture but feels slightly utilitarian.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mirelle is a compelling focalizer, and the "eccentric old woman" disguise is executed with consistent behavioral details that serve the plot. While the archetype of the invisible servant is familiar, her internal resolve and the specific physical toll of her deception ("trembling hands") ground the character effectively. The motivation is clear and drives the scene’s urgency without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Meera and her client are rendered with empathy, though they function more as archetypes (the wise healer, the grieving penitent) than idiosyncratic individuals. Meera is described as "cryptic," yet her dialogue is helpful and explanatory, creating a mild dissonance between trait labels and on-page action. The emotional shift relies on the magical mechanism rather than a dramatized internal struggle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maricel’s "translator's habit" effectively frames her perception, turning a medical moment into a linguistic struggle that defines her agency. The internal conflict between succumbing to the anesthetic and the "need to witness" is visceral, grounding her motivation in a specific professional ethos rather than generic curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation—the need to reclaim artistic authenticity—is clear and drives the narrative. However, the pivotal shift relies heavily on a "daydream" epiphany triggered by the object rather than an active struggle or hard choice, which softens her agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s agency is distinct, driving the plot through professional risk-taking (chipping the plaster) that aligns with her established motivation. However, the "dreaming" aspect of her interiority feels slightly convenient as a bridge to the surreal elements rather than deeply embodied prior to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias functions as a competent guide but relies on stock archetypes ("charming rogue," "roguish expression") rather than specific, dramatized complexity. His role is primarily expositional and procedural—leading the ritual—rather than revealing character through difficult, pressurized choice. The "rogue" trait is asserted via labels rather than demonstrated through specific tactical cunning or moral ambiguity in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is an archetypal vessel for the story's theme rather than a psychological entity with genuine agency or internal contradiction. Her motivation—transmuting pain to beauty—is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices or mistakes. She endures without visible cost or doubt, resulting in a static portrait that lacks the friction required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exquisite; Miren is defined by a deep, embodied contradiction—a caretaker of "extinct feelings" who is the only one truly feeling them. Her interiority is specific ("foxglove regret") and her agency is absolute; the decision to preserve the flaw is a renunciation of her role that is fully earned by her internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira is a competent, clearly motivated protagonist whose internal conflict—the fear of honesty vs. the need for connection—drives the narrative. The physical manifestation of her struggle (hand cramping, the risk of the ink) grounds the emotional arc effectively. The vulnerability shown in the confession adds necessary depth to the academic archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is a competent, active protagonist whose engineering skills drive the plot. While the grandfather memory serves as a convenient moral anchor and the internal reaction to the glue ("trembled... like voltage") feels slightly melodramatic, her final choice to leave the letter unsealed is a strong, character-specific exercise of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s internal struggle is embodied specifically through her unique backstory as a pigeon trainer, avoiding generic angst. The urge to flee is dramatized as a physical instinct ("bloomed in her chest"), creating a visceral contradiction with her desire to preserve history. Her choice to stay feels earned by the specific retrieval of the meteorite anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s internal landscape is rich, but her arc feels more like a verbalized explanation than a dramatized struggle; she interprets her father’s history with a certainty that lowers the stakes of the inquiry. Her "featherly determination" is stated rather than shown through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Senna's core motivation—a search for "the rhythm of belonging"—is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through action or relationship, making the final decision to abandon her humanity feel abrupt. The emotional leap to a likely suicidal or transhumanist pact lacks sufficient on-page groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marina functions primarily as an observer of the magic system rather than a protagonist facing deep personal cost. Her internal state is descriptive rather than conflicted, and her agency is limited to executing the experiment. The "cheerful gloom" is told as a state she adopts, rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal conflict—improvisation vs. control—is beautifully dramatized through her "analytical fortune-telling." The shift from confident orchestrator to vulnerable player is earned, with the loss at chess serving as a necessary humbling that unlocks the closure. Motivation is rooted deeply in the backstory of her father, making her final choice resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.3)
    Kaleth is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but her internal arc lacks friction; she faces no contradictory impulses or genuine doubt. The transformation feels like an inevitable ascension rather than a hard-won victory, as the "cost" of becoming a living statue is framed as pure triumph without visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.9)
    Internal conflict is resolved through diagnostic labeling ("value wasn't in the extraordinary, but in attention itself") rather than dramatized struggle. The epiphany feels unearned, relying on abstract summary of emotion rather than embodied reaction, triggering the label-speak penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("instrument of both her salvation and her enlightenment") rather than embodied emotion. The protagonist's self-awareness feels overly articulate and therapeutic for the crisis context.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mira acts as a vehicle for the prompt's concepts rather than a breathing character. The label "logical dreamer" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory choices, and her struggle remains abstract. The unison behavior of the parallel selves reduces them to plot devices, and the emotional arc resolves via a convenient epiphany rather than a difficult, character-defining trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by her role and legacy, but her internal arc resolves too smoothly. The shift from the "burden pressing harder" to the "burden feeling lighter" occurs instantly upon discovery, functioning as an intellectual realization rather than an earned emotional shift with visible cost. The attribute "sensitively perceptive" is told as an expository label rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    Vesper is a functional vehicle for the concept but lacks internal friction or agency beyond executing a pre-assigned task. Her "borrowed heartbeat" serves as a static buffer against stress rather than a source of difficult choices or costs. The character remains effectively unchanged, executing a perfect ritual without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren is a compelling focalizer whose "operatively gentle" persona is dramatized through command rather than exposition. Her internal weariness creates a palpable cost for her competence, grounding the "penitent's cross" metaphor in specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is a distinct, contradictory figure, but his pivot from cynical detachment to sentimental grace hinges on the convenient external stimulus of the footprint shape rather than accumulated internal pressure. The "crack inside his chest" beat feels slightly unearned given the strength of his established amoral worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    Celestine serves as an archetypal liberator rather than a realized individual; her motivation is declared through abstract narration rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or doubt. She lacks specific flaws or internal friction, performing the central action with an idealized competence that lowers narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is a distinct, cohesive character; his background as a calligrapher effectively contrasts with his subversive puppetry. The internal shift is motivated and clear, though the pivotal transformation is summarized ("Hours passed") rather than fully dramatized as a struggle, which softens the emotional cost of the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s internal landscape is cohesive, and her motivation (“esoteric realist”) is distinct and drives the narrative logic. However, her arc is somewhat static; the narrative validates her philosophy without forcing her to make a difficult on-page choice or sacrifice under immediate pressure. The emotional release feels inevitable rather than hard-won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira's motivation to preserve lost voices is poignant and drives the narrative effectively. Her internal state is well-rendered, particularly the burden of memory and the release of forgiveness, though the pivotal emotional shift (forgiving herself) occurs in backstory ("yesterday") rather than unfolding under pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist functions effectively as a vessel for the concept, but the "treacherous present" constraint is navigated with little friction or error. The motivation is abstract and philosophical, lacking an embodied emotional cost or struggle that would deepen the character beyond the prompt's definition.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's frugality is established via labels ("patched knees," "cheap camera") and reported backstory rather than tactical necessity or constraint in the moment. Her emotional climax relies on a generic appreciation of "ancient wisdom" and a stated financial cost, rather than a specific, personal price paid on the page to secure the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kale's transition from murderous accusation to "teach me" is instantaneous and unearned by interpersonal struggle; she functions as a passive vessel for the magical vision rather than an agent making a difficult choice. The emotion is often stated via hyperbole ("radiated fury so intense it seemed to warp the air") rather than embodied in complex reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and the "anchor and sail" constraint provides a functional internal framework. However, the emotional stakes feel muffled; she accepts her brother's translucent, "mirror-glass" return with minimal psychological cost or resistance, making the resolution feel too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Character motivations are clear and poignant, with Marta’s guilt driving the action effectively. The relationship acts as a genuine crucible, forcing the protagonist to confront her failure. Lena's shift from confrontation to reconciliation is rapid but follows a logical emotional chain triggered by the shared artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya is consistent and competent, but her pivotal internal shift feels unearned. The "epiphany in the bath" resolves her confusion too smoothly, bypassing the necessary struggle or contradictory impulses that define deep characterization under pressure. The acceptance of a life of isolation arrives with a tidy smile rather than the weight of a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marin is a competent, active protagonist with a distinct skill set (arcane linguistics) that drives the plot. However, her internal landscape lacks contradiction or friction; her choices, while active, feel structurally easy and devoid of personal cost or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "chimera twin" concept uniquely grounds the ghost trope in biology, creating a specific and poignant internal conflict. Mira’s grief is embodied effectively through this connection, making the brother's presence feel biologically intrusive rather than just supernatural.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren is a competent focalizer, but her characterization relies heavily on expository labels ("warmly methodical," "motivation had always been singular") rather than dramatized internal conflict. She encounters no significant resistance or personal cost, resulting in a static arc where she functions more as a plot device than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a complex character under pressure. While his motivation is clear, his internal struggle during the climax—forcing himself to "listen past" the noise—resolves immediately without visible psychological cost or temptation to fail. He lacks a distinct flaw or contradictory impulse that would elevate the narrative beyond a standard quest archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Esme's internal journey relies heavily on convenient epiphany ("she understood," "she knew") rather than active deduction or struggle. Her primary trait, retrocognition, functions as a plot device to deliver exposition rather than a flaw or tool that generates conflict. The "future-echo" at the end removes the necessity of faith, reducing her agency in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s defining trait and primary motivation are delivered via direct exposition ("Elden's deepest motivation had always been...") rather than dramatized through early choices. While the final surrender is thematic, the lack of active struggle against the absorption makes the character feel more like a vessel for the concept than an agent of change.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's arc is largely diagnosed and resolved by the mentor character, who explains his internal state ("Your hands remember things your heart has forgotten") rather than allowing him to discover it through struggle. The emotional pivot from despair to "crying and laughing" feels unearned by the brief on-page action, relying on a sudden breakthrough without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Chen’s interiority is generally grounded, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("facing it straight on would have broken me") rather than embodied cost, effectively explaining his own psychology to the reader. The specific tag "warmly observant nature" acts as a shortcut rather than a demonstrated trait in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s internal conflict—claustrophobia versus the legacy of safety—is brilliantly dramatized through the specific action of collecting silences. Her motivation is unique and deeply felt, driving the scene’s mechanics. The final choice to "welcome herself" is a satisfying, character-specific resolution to the "xenial" setup.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    Marco functions as a static "magical mentor" rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction or personal risk. Elena's transition from rigid grief to acceptance is rapid and unearned by struggle; she absorbs the lesson without the resistance or complexity that would make the emotional shift credible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kaida is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, but her pivotal moment relies on the ruby flake "streaming" the answer directly into her mind rather than her earning the insight through deduction or struggle. The shift from adventurer to servant of memory is stated as a realization rather than dramatized through a difficult choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("love means accommodation") rather than embodied emotion. Mara functions as a static mouthpiece for the theme rather than a conflicted protagonist, and the girl is a mirror without distinct agency. The emotional progression is lectured rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's history with the pyramid scheme effectively grounds the surreal plot in genuine emotional stakes, creating a clear internal arc. However, the key trait "virtuously mischievous" feels told rather than dramatized; the climactic action reads more as intuitive compliance than distinct mischief.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassian’s motivation is well-defined and drives the narrative from the inciting search to the final resolution. However, his internal landscape relies on somewhat melodramatic summary ("worn that title like a curse," "complete darkness") rather than embodied emotion, and the "intuition" trait feels like a prompt insertion rather than an organic character driver.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivation is sharply drawn, pivoting from a desire for solitude to a surrender to "true" duty. The internal conflict regarding his past cowardice is recontextualized effectively through the memory of the oath. The transition to the final state of "shivering bliss" is rapid but intellectually earned by the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    Miriam’s internal landscape is legible, but her backstory—being left at the altar—feels like a parallel trait rather than an integrated constraint that forces the present choice. She observes and remedies the past without facing a significant personal cost or conflicting impulse in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira is competent and her tactical choices (photographing quickly, choosing the vault) are clear, but she lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. Her characterization relies heavily on external definitions ("disaffected youth") and expository backstory rather than behavior under pressure that challenges her own flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus is a consistent focalizer with clear interiority regarding his grandmother. However, the motivation of "family ruin" remains abstract and untethered to specific consequences, lowering the felt stakes of his success.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on summary ("finding comfort," "became an obsession") rather than dramatized behavior in a specific scene. Miren lacks internal conflict; her transformation is passive, resulting from touching a magical object rather than a high-stakes choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is a clearly drawn protagonist with a distinct worldview ("trusting feeling more than precision"). However, his internal journey lacks resistance; he accepts the Admiral's philosophy immediately upon reading the note rather than struggling to integrate it against his established reclusiveness. The emotional stakes remain low-pressure, making the final transformation feel smooth rather than earned through difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motivation is compelling and drives the narrative, and her empathy is well-dramatized. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into abstract labeling ("stomach clench with luminous regret"), and the magistrate’s emotional shift—from seventeen years of denial to acceptance—feels slightly rushed given the brevity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael is defined by a compelling professional heresy, and her empathy is active rather than passive, driving the integration process. While her internal risk is low—she operates with high competence—her specific worldview and "modestly fearless" demeanor anchor the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sera’s transition from defensive tension to "bracing against peace" creates a strong, character-specific emotional arc. The "math of mercy" is well-integrated into her worldview, driving the conflict between her past logic and present bodily reality without devolving into stock trauma tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction; her motivation is clear, but she moves from desire to fulfillment without grappling with conflicting impulses or making difficult trade-offs. The emotional cues ("throat tight") feel signaled rather than embodied through complex reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is a competent professional with a consistent voice, though his motivation ("daughter asked him") feels expository rather than dramatized under pressure. His interaction with the ghost as a "client" effectively establishes his worldview and character without needing excessive backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s internal conflict—safety vs. risk—is effectively externalized by the Operator and anchored by the bottled whisper. While she is reactive for the first half, the reveal that her own fear created the loop grants her agency in retrospect, and her final acceptance feels earned. The psychological cost of losing her "perfect equilibrium" is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kasimir’s internal conflict between his failed revolutionary past and his current obsolescence is compelling and well-drawn. The shift from shame to a new kind of "emotional archaeology" is earned through specific memories and the interaction with the shard.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.8)
    Aldric is a competent archetype rather than a character under pressure; he faces a technical puzzle with perfect expertise and no internal conflict. There is no visible cost to his choices, and his emotional state is largely static, resulting in a functional but flat protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s internal landscape is rendered with exceptional clarity; the conflict between her "sensible" collector persona and the "hinged awakening" of the unknown drives the narrative. The final renunciation of safety is earned through the psychometric connection to Henrik, making the character arc feel inevitable yet costly. The shift from observer to participant is dramatized through specific physical actions (removing boots, abandoning the compass).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s internal motivation is clear and consistent, but her epiphany feels intellectual and frictionless rather than earned through genuine struggle or cost. The shift in her artistic philosophy is legible, yet the emotional stakes remain low as the realization arrives without a difficult tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s internal artistic struggle is legible, but Father Benedict functions purely as a thematic delivery device rather than a fully realized character. His dialogue exists solely to unlock Mara’s problem, lacking distinct personal agency or conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Malik's professional background as an archivist effectively motivates his high-stakes acceptance of the burden at the climax. The internal logic holds, though his transition from observer to participant is rapid.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    Miranda is a competent, consistent protagonist, but she lacks internal contradiction or a "crucible" moment of struggle on the page. Her rejection of the guild happens in backstory, leaving her present-tense journey largely devoid of difficult choices or temptation; she is static in her wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on the "chosen one" trope and unearned epiphanies ("Somehow, he understood"). Marcus's transformation from curious boy to devoted archivist occurs entirely in the summary gap between scenes, bypassing the dramatization of his commitment or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clearly dramatized through the tactile interaction with the inheritance; the choice to spend the "unlived years" carries tangible weight. The internal struggle against the fear of the vortex is resolved somewhat efficiently, but the emotional logic remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is a competent focalizer with a clear motivation, but she lacks internal friction; she is undeniably right from the start, making the narrative a validation of her expertise rather than a struggle with genuine doubt. The lack of a character-based cost or difficult choice (beyond physical exertion) limits the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.3)
    Kael is static; her primary conflict (leaving Earth) is backstory rather than a present-tense struggle. She lacks contradictory impulses in the scene, and her internal state is summarized through labels ("spiritually curious," "armored against uncertainty") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara functions more as a thematic vessel than a fleshy character; her internal landscape is described through abstract labels ("astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than dramatized contradiction. While her decision to open the box drives the plot, the moment lacks visceral resistance or the cost of breaking the covenant, making the choice feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mira functions as an archetypal guardian rather than a dynamic character; she lacks internal contradiction or specific, dramatized struggle beyond her role. While her motivation is consistent, she faces no difficult choices on the page, resulting in a static performance where she lectures rather than navigates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren functions as a stable mentor figure rather than a protagonist under pressure; her internal conflict is summarized as backstory ("spent months writing fractured poems") rather than dramatized in the present. The interaction with the boy is gentle but lacks friction or risk; her "warmly attentive" response feels like a fixed trait rather than a hard-won stance in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren functions as a consistent vessel for the premise but lacks internal friction or contradiction; her "brazen calm" is static from the inciting diagnosis to the end. There is no "crucible" moment where her values are tested against her mortality; she simply accepts and executes. The emotional arc is flat because the character enters the story already fully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s internal shift from clinical observer to "reluctant pilgrim" is dramatized effectively through the dialogue and prop work. The interaction with Quorum forces a crystallization of her stance that feels earned rather than stated. Quorum’s alien perspective ("more verb than noun") provides excellent foil pressure without descending into caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is competent and distinct, fitting the fable-like tone, but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. He functions as a vehicle for the reclamation theme rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure; his actions are efficient execution rather than struggles against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.4)
    Calder functions primarily as a vessel for thematic delivery rather than a fleshed-out character; his dialogue ("Distance is what killed us") leans heavily into exposition. While Mercy offers a grounded POV filter, neither character faces internal contradiction or genuine cost. The emotional arc from resignation to purpose is instantaneous, lacking the friction of doubt or habit.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya is a distinct focalizer with clear internal logic, but she remains largely static. The "blessed pariah" identity serves as a label for immunity rather than a source of active struggle or choice in the scene. Her primary action is observation, resulting in a portrait of a state of being rather than a character tested by pressure.

    Character motivation is stated clearly ("to amend"), but the protagonist lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; the "fear" mentioned is resolved instantly without resistance. The mentor figure offers immediate validation, leaving the protagonist's growth feeling granted rather than earned through agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is a coherent focalizer with a clear backstory that informs her worldview, but her internal landscape lacks active contradiction or struggle in the present scene. The transition from crisis actor to historian is intellectually engaging but feels summarized rather than emotionally embodied under pressure. The interaction with the archivist is frictionless; they align immediately without status dynamics or skepticism, resulting in a lack of interpersonal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's unique physiology (mercury-glass) is brilliantly integrated with her internal conflict of reflection versus refraction. Her motivation to find "the shape of home" drives the narrative clearly. The backstory of parents with "narrow minds" feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of her present condition, but the final choice to integrate the stone is a strong, earned character beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Petrov is compellingly drawn, with specific traits like "productive fidgeting" anchored in his chess background that evolve into stillness at the end. His internal arc—converting shame into understanding—is poignant and drives the narrative, though the final realization about the duchess feels slightly rationalized to fit the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara is a deeply realized protagonist whose internal conflict (guilt vs. artistic integrity) drives every beat. Her refusal to simplify her truth creates a compelling psychological struggle that integrates perfectly with the external plot. The resolution—embracing the fracture rather than rejecting it—feels earned by her consistent agency.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s desperation and physical struggle are vividly embodied, creating a strong anchor for the narrative. The transition from uncertainty to "newly certain purpose" feels slightly rushed, relying on the magical vision to resolve her internal conflict rather than a purely character-driven realization. However, her choice to push past oxygen debt demonstrates clear agency and establishes the cost of her success.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren’s shift from detached observer to engaged participant is well-motivated and dramatized through the painting process. The internal struggle in the cave earns the epiphany, validating the catalyst of the broken mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist Mira lacks internal conflict, functioning primarily as a vessel for the grandmother's wisdom rather than a character with doubts or flaws. Thomas serves as a straw man antagonist who capitulates instantly without struggle, stripping the narrative of genuine relational pressure. The didactic nature of the characterization flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation—resisting the collective pull to understand it—is compelling and clearly drawn. The transition from grief-stricken survivor to purposeful navigator feels earned, with the final choice to "navigate what remains" providing a strong character arc rooted in renunciation. Her interiority effectively balances the technical and the emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s internal conflict is clear, but her shift from isolationist to healer relies on diagnostic self-awareness ("isolation wearing a protective mask") rather than embodied struggle. The realization feels filtered through analysis rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Magnus is a distinct, thoughtful focalizer, and his trait of "noting what wasn't there" effectively drives the investigation. His internal motivation—tending the gaps—is compelling, though the connection to the "borrowed memories" feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by character pressure alone. The "confessionals" line establishes his worldview beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Martin is a coherent, sympathetic focalizer, and his shift from stagnation to openness is legible. However, his motivation for the inciting incident ("something pulled him") is vague, and his defining attribute ("empirically intuitive") relies on told labels rather than dramatized behavior to solve the scene's central puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's central realization is delivered via external dialogue from the grotto ("You are the mystery..."), which renders her passive at the climax. While her motivation is clear, the transformation relies on diagnostic statements ("forgotten what it means to feel") rather than embodied action or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    Solène is a clear focalizer with a defined worldview, but her interiority is delivered largely through exposition rather than struggle. The relationship with Mira lacks friction; they are in perfect alignment, which robs the scene of an interpersonal crucible to test Solène's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maren is a compelling conceptual vessel, but her interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic labeling ("chronologically confused," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied struggle. While the internal conflict of "feral nostalgia" is potent, it is summarized as a realization rather than dramatized through a difficult choice in the present moment. The character feels static, analyzing her condition rather than living through a pressure-filled beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elena functions primarily as a diagnostic instrument rather than a conflicted protagonist; her empathy is asserted as a backstory superpower rather than earned through on-page struggle. The pivotal realization relies on therapeutic label-speak ("afraid to feel joy") that resolves complex off-page emotions with implausible speed and certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is legible, but interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("stress response," "budding rune scholar") rather than embodied complexity. The pivot from panic to mastery via the "small magic" feels unearned, resolving a physiological crisis with a simple gesture and no residual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    Margot's backstory as a gossip columnist integrates well, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I was just scared—of being ordinary") rather than embodied vulnerability. She psychoanalyzes herself to the ghost in the peak beat, which flattens the emotional reality into a transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael functions primarily as a vessel for the story's concepts rather than a fully realized individual; her interiority relies on labeled abstractions ("feeling time," "understood") rather than embodied emotion. The backstory of the mentor with "trembling hands" reads as a stock genre trope that fails to add specific personal weight to her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren is a compelling focalizer whose shift from technician to shepherd is earned through high-stakes action. Her physical engagement with the "razor edges" creates a visceral cost (bloodied fingers) that grounds her internal realization. The agency is distinct; she does not merely observe the anomaly but actively negotiates with reality to resolve it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s professional lens (intrusion detection) is integrated well into her worldview, creating a distinct internal voice. However, the emotional epiphany feels somewhat therapeutic and tidy, resolved by an external prop rather than a pressure-cooked internal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s internal conflict between mathematical logic and emotional desperation is compelling, grounding her obsession effectively. However, the pivotal epiphany is triggered by an external message ("WIDEN YOUR VIEW") rather than a purely internal realization, which slightly softens the agency of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sarah’s internal conflict between bureaucratic duty and human empathy is dramatized effectively. The choice to break protocol is earned by the specific memory of the harmonica, though her "personal philosophy" feels slightly pre-packaged rather than discovered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    Maren functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; she witnesses the climax but does not drive it through choice or struggle. Her internal state is summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the resolution is explained to her by other characters rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s characterization relies on summary and stated traits (e.g., the repeated label "desperately jocular") rather than behavior dramatized under pressure. While her motivation is clear, the internal shift from isolation to connection is intellectualized in the narrative ("suddenly she understood") rather than earned through a visible emotional struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera’s motivation (grief) is clear, but her internal journey relies heavily on summary and diagnostic labels ("topology of loss," "fluent in stillness") rather than embodied struggle. The pivotal realization is delivered via the phrase "suddenly understood," shortcutting the dramatic processing of the emotion. The character feels more like a vehicle for the concept than a distinct agent navigating resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict—order versus chaos—is externalized perfectly through her interaction with the pen and the signal. The shift from observer to participant is earned via the "confident uncertainty" trait, leading to a climax that feels inevitable yet transformative. The psychological cost of abandoning "rigid certainty" is palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.7)
    Marina is passive; the advisor Theo drives the plot, provides the technology, and solves the central problem. Her internal state relies on the "tragic disability" trope without specific, embodied nuance or contradiction. The emotional arc is linear and lacks the friction of genuine character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist with specific, high-stakes motivation grounded in a distinct personal history. Her interiority is sharp, balancing the "criminal" persona with academic rigor, though the emotional climax relies slightly on stated feeling rather than purely dramatized reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theo's drumming habit serves as an excellent grounding detail that physicalizes his resistance and eventual connection. However, reliance on diagnostic interiority ("isolation was the real disease") and label-speak for emotion ("felt auroral sorrow") at peak moments flattens the character arc into summary rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.4)
    Marcus functions as a highly competent archetype with no visible flaws or internal conflict. He solves the puzzle without struggle or doubt, resulting in a static character arc that lacks emotional cost or vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina's motivation is clearly established, but the "instant understanding" between her and the Guardian bypasses necessary interpersonal conflict. The lack of friction in their interaction reduces the emotional weight of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Miss Chen is a strongly realized mentor figure with a consistent voice. Danny feels slightly functional; his pivot from resignation to rebellion is efficient but relies heavily on Chen’s persuasive monologue rather than internal friction or a visible realization of his own agency before the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira and Kael are functional archetypes whose emotional pivot relies on stated longing rather than dramatized friction. The shift from "phantom weight of obligations" to the decision to leave happens too rapidly to feel earned, and Kael's vulnerability is summarized via labels ("wounds Mira had learned to recognize") rather than shown through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marcus's performative narration is a brilliant, specific tool that dramatizes his internal conflict and coping mechanism without needing exposition. Emma's transition from the &quot;performer's mask&quot; to emotional vulnerability is rapid but earned by the shared focus on the bouquet. The dynamic effectively portrays the tension between survival habits and the need for authentic connection.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.5)
    Meris functions more as a vehicle for the story's aesthetic theory than a living character with contradictory impulses. Her motivation is stated in abstract terms ("visceral knowledge") rather than dramatized through struggle or hesitation. The interaction with Kael lacks friction; he validates her immediately, leaving her internal landscape static.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maya functions as a flawless catalyst rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal resistance, blind spots, or meaningful cost. Her talent works perfectly on the first attempt without forcing a difficult choice or adaptation, leaving her emotional arc flat and the "barter" feeling transactional rather than sacrificial.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maren is an intriguing concept—a living instrument—but she lacks agency in the present moment; her "choice" to conduct the experiment faces no internal or external resistance. The volunteer serves merely as a compliant prop to validate her thesis, leaving the protagonist's internal landscape largely static despite the rich bio-mod details.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    Characters articulate their psychological states with diagnostic precision ("particular species of brokenness," "permission to feel") rather than embodying them. This "therapy-speak" flattens the emotional reality, making the grief feel performed rather than lived. The apprentice’s struggle is resolved largely through compliant nodding and off-page work rather than interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vesper is competent but static; her skills resolve the plot without forcing her to confront a personal flaw or pay a significant price. The "steadily curious" attribute acts as a retrospective label rather than a driver of active, costly inquiry in the scene. The lack of friction in her dynamic with Marcus leaves the emotional arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is established, but the emotional arc feels rushed; the protagonist moves from trembling anticipation to weeping realization with minimal on-page resistance or specific interior struggle. The "surrender to chaos" beat is summarized rather than dramatized, reducing agency and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sera acts as a functional vehicle for the theme rather than a conflicted individual; her internal state is linear (suspicion to confirmation to action) without contradictory impulses. The specific character tag "dusk noticer" feels like a prompt label rather than an integrated trait. The repetition of the phrase "softly deliberate" to describe her mannerisms flattens her distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s internal conflict—shame versus conviction—is rendered with clarity, and her motivation to restore integrity drives the scene. However, the shift from disgraced fraudster to confident qualitative researcher feels slightly rushed, resolving a career-ending crisis with a pivot in methodology that lacks sufficient on-page struggle or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist whose internal conflict—the compulsion to reopen wounds versus the promise of healing—is dramatized through specific action. Her motivation is distinct and drives the narrative engine, linking her physical pain directly to the gathering of information. The revelation regarding Dr. Venn recontextualizes their earlier interaction effectively, adding depth to the relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    Celeste is a functional protagonist who drives the investigation, but she lacks internal friction or genuine personal stakes. A potential personal connection to the letters ("initials she recognized from her grandmother's stories") is introduced but dropped without payoff, leaving her motivation feeling generic.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Celestine functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized character; her internal conflict ("dreams becoming rigid with fear") is asserted in the resolution rather than dramatized during the rising action. Her ability to solve the central problem is immediate and lacks the friction of trial and error, making her competence feel unearned. The "moonstruck" label substitutes for demonstrated personality traits or specific idiosyncratic behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren is a competent, consistent protagonist who fits the story’s mythic tone, but she lacks the embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. Her "dreamlessness" reads more as a cool trait than a felt cost affecting on-page choices. She faces no temptation to deviate from her role, resulting in a performance that feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist fits the "philosopher" archetype but lacks individual specificity or internal contradiction. His motivation is stated in exposition ("abandoned his position... to rediscover") rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices in the scene. He succeeds effortlessly at his task, facing no resistance or potential for failure, which limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s internal pivot from panic to "lighter" feels rushed and relies on therapeutic prompting from the guides rather than dramatized pressure. The guides function more as plot devices delivering wisdom than as fully realized characters, and Mara's epiphany lacks sufficient on-page struggle to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rielle’s physical numbness effectively mirrors her psychological state, grounding the internal conflict in the body. Silent-Choir communicates distinct agency and history without dialogue, creating a strong dual-character dynamic. The shared trauma is dramatized through action rather than just introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    Ossian functions as a static archetype rather than a character; he faces no internal conflict, doubt, or cost. His competence is absolute, reducing the narrative to a procedural execution of duty without emotional stakes. The "diminutive titan" trait is purely physical description and does not inform his perspective or tactical choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara functions as a passive observer/decoder rather than a character with contradictory impulses or distinct interiority. The climax relies on an external key (the code) rather than a character-driven choice or sacrifice, leaving her emotional arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kess is physically grounded through the "barefoot" detail, but her internal arc feels more like a vehicle for the theme than a genuine psychological struggle. Her "overwhelming need" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices, and her epiphany arrives via external delivery (the message on the stones) rather than internal pressure or necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Naja is a distinct presence with a compelling backstory and grounded voice ("pruned fingers"). However, she faces little internal resistance or fear regarding the alien transformation, accepting it too smoothly. This lack of emotional friction or hesitation in the face of radical change flattens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    Character interiority is established through the specific "pearl" coping mechanism, but the reliance on diagnostic summary ("Dr. Reeves... explained somatic markers") creates a clinical distance. The protagonist feels static; her traits are often stated ("quietly talented") rather than pressure-tested in the brief scene with the couple.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (rejection vs. artistic truth) is well-drawn and mirrored by the external threat. However, the climax relies on diagnostic internalization ("She understood now... fragmentation was the human condition") rather than embodying the realization purely through action, which creates a slight distance at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's albinism serves as a tangible constraint that shapes his physical movement and adversarial relationship with the setting. The backstory regarding his mother effectively anchors the philosophical conflict, transforming the hunt into a personal quest for understanding without devolving into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and her final micro-choice (waking a specific witness rather than all) demonstrates meaningful agency. However, the narrative relies on diagnostic labeling ("She was bravely conflicted") to establish her internal state rather than dramatizing the oscillation of her impulse, which distances the reader from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivations are deeply embodied; Mira’s resistance is active, rooted in a specific philosophy that contrasts sharply with Kael’s volatility. The "senselessly perceptive" trait is functional, allowing her to read the threat (the blade) and navigate the conversation without exposition. Kael’s internal conflict is shown through physical action (the blade handling) rather than dialogue, creating a strong "relationship as crucible" dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara is a distinct, highly competent focalizer with clear agency and specific interiority (using "longing" as bait). However, her lack of significant internal conflict or error makes her feel slightly static; she succeeds through established mastery rather than a realized on-page struggle or vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Celeste’s internal logic is compelling, seamlessly blending her personas as astronomer and heiress to drive the narrative. The shift from doubt to admiration is earned through a specific intellectual process ("proof by contradiction"), though the emotional resolution feels slightly smoother and less costly than the "heaviness" of the setup implies.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera's guilt regarding her nephew is compelling and grounded in her professional background ("distinguish hunger from pain"). However, the shift in the climax where she metaphorically becomes a "constellation tattooist" feels disconnected from her established identity as a researcher. The internal resolution relies slightly too much on abstract healing rather than a dramatized behavioral change.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moth is a compelling protagonist whose internal landscape of loss ("taste of honey") perfectly mirrors the external stakes. Her motivation to find an anchor through art is dramatized through specific, costly choices (interjecting to stop the man from forcing the memory). The characterization is dense and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Layla’s motivation is clear and consistent, grounded in a specific backstory of refusal. However, her internal struggle is largely summarized rather than dramatized in the present; the transition from "shaking" trauma to mastery of the ritual feels rapid and lacks a moment of doubt or near-failure to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    Margaux’s motivation is clear (desire for an audience), but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her primary action—performing—is facilitated by a convenient magical object rather than a difficult choice or personal sacrifice. The characterization relies on the synesthesia trait, which functions as descriptive ornamentation rather than a driver of behavior or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara is defined primarily by her condition rather than active agency; she faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice in the scene, functioning largely as a vehicle for the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maren is a functional protagonist with a clear role, but her internal journey lacks resistance. She moves from observation to mastery without a moment of genuine doubt or a choice that requires sacrifice; the "burden" mentioned is not dramatized through cost. The epiphany feels granted rather than earned through struggle against her limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara serves primarily as a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or a struggle between competing desires. Her motivation is stated ("quietly inspired," "wanted to spin a prophecy") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or embodied emotion. Relationships are expository, lacking friction or genuine interplay that tests character.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Marcus is a functional archetype, but his internal shift relies on reading a message rather than dramatized choice. The journalist's instant recruitment ("Show me") bypasses the necessary struggle of earning trust, flattening the relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s "ambient awareness" and the woman’s nervous engagement create a compelling, compressed dynamic. The coachman’s intervention is perfectly calibrated to his established character—observant and reticent—and the woman’s shift from anxiety to acceptance is earned through the dialogue. The characterization relies slightly on the "wise ferryman" archetype, but the specific execution regarding the needle grounds it in unique details.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for the theme, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her primary action is to sit and listen to a lecture; she undergoes no struggle or difficult choice on the page. The "zen-minded" trait manifests as a lack of agency rather than a specific, embodied personality.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation, but she lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. Her journey is linear—confirming what she already knows rather than struggling through a difficult choice or cost. The emotional landscape is stable rather than dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    The thylacine memories are vivid and grounded ("concrete confines," "hollow ache"), offering a strong anchor. However, the protagonist's present-day interiority relies on abstract summaries ("translate isolation into independence") rather than embodied struggle, and her acceptance of the resolution feels unearned by on-page agency.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margot's interiority is rich, but Sena's dialogue ("You've been looking for the pattern") feels expository, diagnosing the protagonist's motivation externally rather than allowing it to remain subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s competence is established early and drives the plot, but she lacks internal contradiction or genuine vulnerability; the victory feels earned by expertise rather than a difficult micro-choice with personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara is drawn with clear traits, but "prudently adventurous" appears as an inserted label rather than a driver of specific tactical choices in the scene. The claustrophobia provides texture but functions more as a static hurdle she "forces herself" past rather than a conflict that complicates the puzzle-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena is a distinct focalizer with a compelling trait, but her prosopagnosia functions more as a paradoxical superpower than a source of genuine on-page struggle. The lack of internal conflict or friction reduces the character arc to a demonstration of competence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motivation is legible, but her internal state relies on label-like telling (e.g., "spongey dread," "nervously confident") rather than embodied reaction. Dr. Kao functions primarily as a sounding board, converting from skeptic to accomplice with insufficient resistance, which flattens the relationship dynamics and lowers the stakes of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara functions as a competent procedural solver rather than a conflicted protagonist; her motivation is stated ("sculpt possibility") rather than dramatized through struggle. The lack of internal resistance or contradictory impulses makes her choices feel inevitable and costless.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marco is drawn with interior precision, and his reaction to the father—pulse steadying—effectively dramatizes his "polished calm." The father’s conversion from robber to resident feels slightly rushed; his capitulation ("Show me your markers") lacks the friction or resistance that would make the reversal feel fully earned by the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Character motivation and backstory are clear, with Mara's exhaustion and Ashwin's fate providing emotional stakes. However, the relationship between Mara and Elias lacks friction; they move to perfect cooperation instantly, creating a dynamic that feels slightly functional rather than tested by the pressure of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s characterization is efficient and functional, driven by the pivot from "comfort" to "war-song" upon discovering the seeds. This micro-choice reveals her competence and worldview ("not gentleness but the strength") without needing extensive backstory. The apprentice’s motivation is clearly dramatized through the prop of the seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira functions as an archetype ("root-bound") rather than a fully realized individual; her internal state is described through metaphor rather than dramatized through distinct, contradictory desires. The "anxious elation" is stated as a label rather than shown through embodied behavior. While her motivation is clear, the lack of interpersonal friction or internal resistance limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Marcus’s specific, embodied reaction to the borrowed joy—feeling like he "swallowed wasps"—is an excellent dramatization of internal conflict. The choice to accept pain is earned by this visceral rejection of the alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus creates a compelling synthesis of roadie grit and antique expertise, grounding the conflict in a specific, lived history. However, the pivotal moment relies on diagnostic self-awareness in dialogue ("I brought facts to something that needs feeling") that reads more like a thematic summary than authentic character speech.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.3)
    Emilia functions primarily as a passive recipient of the plot; she plants the seed because she was told to and eats the fruit because it appears. Her stated "scientific mind" offers no genuine resistance to the magical events, resulting in a lack of internal conflict or costly decision-making. The "methodical" trait is asserted but contradicted by her impulsive consumption of an unknown specimen.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris functions effectively as a mentor archetype, though her internal conflict is largely resolved prior to the scene, making her somewhat static. Her backstory as a fisherman provides nice texture, but the emotional heavy lifting is outsourced to the visitor rather than the focal character.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's transformation is instantaneous and unearned; he reads a note and immediately abandons his professional detachment without internal struggle or visible cost. The epiphany feels like a function of the plot rather than a character-driven choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's scientific coping mechanism is distinctive, but the emotional arc feels sanitized and linear for an unmedicated breakdown. The internal state is often summarized via diagnostic metaphors ("vertigo of unmedicated consciousness") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or messy behavior in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the plot until the final realization recontextualizes her goal. While the grandmother’s revealed motivation is complex, the protagonist's own emotional state is often summarized via labels ("cautious exuberance") rather than embodied in specific reactions or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s internal conflict is well-defined, but her resolution relies on a "cultivated network" of allies introduced only in the final paragraph. This convenient resource diminishes the isolation and stakes established by the dilemma, allowing her to bypass the hardest edge of the choice.

    Lyra is a competent professional who faces no internal contradiction or meaningful risk. While her expertise is rendered well, she functions more as a camera than a protagonist under pressure; she makes no difficult choices and pays no personal cost, resulting in a static character arc that relies entirely on procedural success.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Keiko is grounded by specific details of her caretaking past ("spooning soup into cracked lips"), giving her motivation emotional weight. However, her internal arc is resolved primarily by the mentor figure explaining the lesson to her, rather than Keiko earning the realization through an active choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict—certainty versus doubt—is sharply drawn and drives the narrative arc effectively. The "conscience for hire" conceit quickly establishes high stakes for her identity, and the shift from rigid judgment to inquiry feels earned by the backstory pressure (Vincent). The interaction with the keeper serves the protagonist's arc well, though the keeper functions primarily as a catalyst rather than a fully dimensional character.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    The researcher is a clear archetype (the tragic sage), but her emotional state is stated ("sad and knowing") rather than dramatized through friction. The student functions largely as a prop with unearned intensity; his "trembling hands" and "fear" feel melodramatic without a dramatized cause in the scene. The dynamic is standard master-apprentice without a reversal of status or unexpected reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.6)
    Kael functions as a competent archetype rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal contradiction or a "crucible" moment. His motivation is purely functional—fix the tower—and he faces no difficult micro-choices that reveal personality beyond professional duty. The emotion is stated ("weathered resolve") rather than embodied through conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s internal conflict—adequacy versus authenticity—is well-dramatized through her physical struggle and memories. However, the epiphany relies on diagnostic interiority ("Maren realized her grandmother hadn't been teaching her to achieve anything") rather than letting the moment breathe through action alone, slightly flattening the emotional discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is competent and driven, but her journey is one of linear execution rather than character-testing struggle. She faces physical discomfort (cold water), but experiences no moment of doubt, significant sacrifice, or conflicting impulse that would deepen her arc beyond simple quest completion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on stated traits rather than conflicting impulses in scene. Kael’s swift transition from "stellar doubt" to "Teach me" removes relational friction too easily, missing an opportunity to test Mira's conviction against genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s internal landscape is legible and her motivation to find solace is clear, though the psychology relies on stock genre tropes ("if she still possessed such a thing") rather than individuated traits. The emotional weight rests largely on a summarized flashback, which distances the reader from the immediate cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Emris’s "lukewarm" limitation is effectively turned into the narrative's central asset, grounding the resolution in character-specific mechanics. However, his "earnest naivety" and "brittle devotion" are established primarily through summary exposition ("He believed that devotion could substitute...") rather than being dramatized through interaction or resistance in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus serves largely as a passive vessel for Eleanor’s exposition, following her trail and listening rather than driving the scene with active agency. While his internal shift from warden to witness is legible, it lacks a decisive on-page choice or resistance; the "precisely humane" trait is attributed via dialogue rather than dramatized through a difficult present-tense trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but the character lacks internal contradiction or grit; her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The &quot;secretly sentimental&quot; trait is stated and symbolically represented (handkerchief) but never forces a difficult trade-off or cost in the scene. The emotional arc is linear, moving from anticipation to satisfaction without a moment of genuine doubt or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera's internal landscape is well-rendered, with the parachute buckle serving as an effective objective correlative for her trauma and resilience. Her motivation—avoiding her predecessor's collapse—adds necessary weight to the central choice, though the "muscle memory" trait feels slightly over-articulated as a theme rather than just shown in action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional; Kira’s admission of lovelessness (“I don’t love her”) creates a visceral, unexpected contradiction that elevates the conflict beyond a standard custody dispute. The clone’s foil role effectively highlights Kira’s numbness, and the resolution is earned through a credible internal recontextualization of that flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Margot is a distinct professional with clear motivation, but her immediate acceptance of the "gardening sabotage" theory feels like a logical leap convenient for the plot rather than an earned deduction. The connection between her specific competence (pattern recognition) and the epiphany is stated rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Martin's grief is palpably rendered through action, and his transition from solitude to shared ritual is moving. Sarah's shift from observer to participant is emotionally necessary but feels slightly rushed in execution, smoothing over the "crucible" aspect of the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maris is a compelling protagonist with a well-dramatized duality between feral instinct and scholarly intellect. Her internal conflict drives the narrative, though the "feral" side is filtered through a highly articulate internal monologue rather than raw sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Cassia's motivation to redeem her legacy is clear, but her emotional arc relies heavily on summarized internal states ("hopeless," "disappointment") rather than embodied reactions. The transition from lifelong failure to sudden mastery feels unearned by the immediate scene dynamics, as the internal struggle is resolved through a singular, successful action rather than a difficult trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira's motivation is clearly stated ("find the beginning in every ending") but functions more as a thematic label than a source of visceral drive or conflict. The internal struggle between protocol and intuition is resolved too easily, with the transition from doubt to epiphany lacking the friction or error that characterizes deep characterization. Her emotional arc feels smoothed over, missing the contradictory impulses of a 9-band character.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.3)
    Mateo functions as a plot device rather than a character; his "resiliently positive energy" is applied as a diagnostic label rather than a dramatized trait under pressure. He lacks internal conflict or flaws, solving complex dimensional physics instantly without error, doubt, or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marina's motivation is clear but linear; she lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting desires required to generate high-stakes character friction. The "fever dream architect" identity is a strong hook, but her emotional journey relies on summarized realization rather than dramatized struggle against her own resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Carta’s obsession is vividly rendered, and her interiority regarding the chain link provides strong emotional grounding. The characterization is limited only by the lack of a difficult, high-stakes choice in the scene; the interaction is largely transactional (she asks, she receives) rather than a test of character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mira is a competent functionary rather than a dynamic character; she faces no internal opposition, pays no personal cost, and her backstory is summarized rather than dramatized. The "contact tracer" identity is engaging, but she operates as a flawless helper archetype who resolves the external problem without experiencing significant pressure or transformation herself.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is a competent, motivated focalizer with clear interiority. However, her claustrophobia functions as atmospheric texture rather than a constraint that forces a difficult trade-off; her path is linear endurance rather than a complex decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s internal state is well-rendered through the heartbeat motif, though the repetition of "one-two-three" borders on mechanical. The transition from guilt to peace is earned emotionally, though the absolution comes from an external source (Chen's note) rather than internal growth, slightly softening the character's agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sarielle is a distinct, evocative protagonist with clear motivation rooted in cultural preservation. However, her journey lacks an on-page moment of acute internal struggle or decision; the cost (dimming veins) happens to her as a consequence of the ritual rather than through a dramatized trade-off she actively negotiates.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s internal conflict between vindictive skepticism and the seduction of the "harmony" is well-dramatized, shifting credibly when she hears Voss. The transition is earned, though the specific phrasing of her emotional pivot ("clinical detachment crack like ice") relies on a stock metaphor that flattens the moment's psychological nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mira functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a conflicted agent; her motivation is abstract ("reawaken beauty") and meets no internal resistance. She lacks a distinct psychological footprint or contradictory impulses, moving from intention to success without a moment of doubt or difficult choice. The characterization relies on role description rather than dramatized, costly agency.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maren is a competent professional, but her motivation is framed as abstract philosophy ("find where broken promises heal") rather than embodied drive, making her feel slightly idealized and lacking in contradictory internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character is a romanticized archetype of the "silent artisan" without internal conflict or contradiction. His motivation is explained via summary exposition ("He saw silence not as absence...") rather than revealed through difficult choices or behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cordelia is a distinct focalizer with a clear objective, but her journey lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her path is linear and unopposed, reducing the character work to enacting a ritual rather than navigating a dilemma with personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her transition from librarian to "Dream Walker" lacks sufficient internal friction or felt cost. Since she is already isolated, the decision to abandon her life feels like a drift rather than a high-stakes sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara's motivation is clear, but her agency is undercut by the Locksmith, who guides her through every step and literally points out the solution ("Look closer"). Her internal transition from "I don't know" to "I'm ready" relies on a mentor's reassurance rather than an earned epiphany or paid cost. The "unassumingly bold" trait is attributed to the off-screen sister rather than dramatized through Mara's own choices in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s internal conflict between her preservationist training and her personal desperation is vividly dramatized. The climax, where "habits broke," serves as a strong, earned pivot that resolves this tension with a clear character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.9)
    Character motivation is stated directly in exposition ("Her motivation had always been singular...") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The dialogue relies on diagnostic label-speak ("defensive formations around a central void") which breaks naturalism, especially in a conversation with a child. Finn functions more as a prop for the lesson than a fully realized agent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mara is a competent, consistent archetype ("wise magical preserver"), but she lacks internal friction or psychological texture. Her motivation is noble but abstract, and she faces no difficult choice or dilemma; she simply executes a procedural task without doubt or significant personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maren is a competent functionary rather than a character under pressure; she performs the restoration without personal risk, hesitation, or internal cost. Her interiority explains the magic system rather than revealing contradictory desires or vulnerabilities. The "broken mask" moniker is an interesting label that remains expository rather than integrated into a specific identity crisis or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maren is a competent, active protagonist whose cartographic expertise credibly drives the discovery. However, her internal state relies on diagnostic labels like "shielded openness" rather than purely dramatized emotion, slightly distancing the reader from the cost of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Character motivation is clear and the backstory integration (Alice/Amelia) effectively shapes the protagonist's worldview. However, interiority relies frequently on diagnostic summary ("broken something fundamental," "hollow recognition") rather than embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    Moth is a competent archetype who performs her role without internal friction or contradiction; she lacks a dilemma that would force a character-defining choice. Her interiority is summarized in backstory rather than embodied in the immediate pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren is grounded and her final decision constitutes a clear Decisive Change. However, her defining trait ("warmly inquisitive nature") is asserted via backstory summary rather than dramatized through on-page interaction or observation in the present moment, making the characterization feel slightly labeled until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elena’s choice to prioritize observation over panic during the tether crisis perfectly dramatizes her motivation and distinct worldview. Her internal conflict between scientific rigor and her grandfather's legacy drives the narrative effectively, grounding the abstract concept in character-specific desire.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—technical mastery versus spiritual blindness—is dramatized well through the tactile method. The choice to abandon the attempt at "recognition" in favor of "honesty" (the reflected stars) provides a solid character arc, though the initial reaction ("laughed") feels slightly staged.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Celeste’s transition from dutiful apprentice to co-conspirator is earned through specific internal logic and contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to erase the chalk marks is a potent, defining choice that dramatizes her "diligently curious" nature evolving into a survival instinct. This action creates a visible cost: the burden of a dangerous secret and a necessary deception of her master.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Miren is a competent functionary who performs the repair without internal conflict or contradictory impulses. While her expertise is established, she lacks a personal stake or a moment of doubt that would deepen the characterization beyond her role.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara acts as a benevolent plot device rather than a character under pressure; she experiences no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or personal cost for her intervention. Her motivation is stated in summary ("I’ve seen what happens") rather than dramatized through a struggle that tests her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is competent and her motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("beautifully flawed," "bruised awe") rather than dramatized psychological depth. The designated flaw is stated repeatedly but never obstructs her work or forces a difficult choice; she performs her duty with perfect reverence and skill, making the "flawed" attribute feel like an unearned tag rather than a character engine.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is a capable protagonist whose competence balances her stated reluctance. The internal arc—shifting from viewing the orchard as a curse to a gift—provides a valid Conceptual Repricing, though the epiphany ("recognition dawning like cold water") feels slightly rushed and relies on a sudden cognitive leap rather than a gradual emotional accumulation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s interiority is well-developed, using her background as a polymer chemist to effectively frame her grief. However, the secondary trait of being "symphonically minded" feels slightly layered on rather than organic, creating a dual-metaphor system that crowds the characterization. The emotional arc from frozen rigidity to flowing connection is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera functions effectively as an archetypal guide, and the customer’s desire is legible. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract; the customer’s internal struggle is described ("trembling hands") rather than dramatized through contradictory choices or resistance. The interaction feels smoother than a high-stakes encounter typically warrants.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maron is a clearly defined protagonist with a specific, embodied gift. His motivation is palpable, and the internal conflict between the duty to heal memories and the fear of losing his identity provides a solid spine. However, the climax relies heavily on prior competence ("spent years learning to touch without being consumed") rather than forcing a fresh, high-cost decision in the moment, which slightly dampens the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; her internal life is defined solely by her job and the plot's needs. The prompt attribute "empathetically decisive" is inserted as a label ("She had been empathetically decisive because...") rather than demonstrated through a high-pressure choice between conflicting values.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elena is competent and her goal is clear, but the narrative lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; she moves from expertise to epiphany without a dramatized struggle. The transformation is stated in backstory rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice, resulting in a linear "competence porn" arc.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyra functions as a capable archetype without internal contradiction or distinct flaws; her journey is a linear success sequence devoid of difficult choices or genuine moral struggle. The cost of "fractured" memory is stated in the exposition but not dramatized as a felt loss or impediment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.7)
    Maren is a competent archetype without internal contradiction or competing desires; she executes a plan rather than making difficult choices. The "cost" of her success is merely somatic exhaustion, lacking the moral or relational weight required for high-stakes characterization. She functions as a vehicle for the concept rather than a living consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kavir's internal shift from strategist to listener is clear, but the emotional realization relies on summary ("chest tightened with hopeful melancholy") rather than embodied struggle. The relationship with the daughter is functional but lacks friction; her swift acceptance of his radical view bypasses the potential for deeper interpersonal drama.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marlow's internal conflict—the desire to know versus the need to respect silence—is dramatized well. Her backstory feels slightly list-like ("radio archaeologists") to fit the prompt, but her final renunciation is a strong, character-driven choice that earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("psychological toll," "ambitious plans") rather than embodied reaction in the moment. The transformation occurs via generalized reflection over weeks rather than through a specific, high-pressure choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara is competent and active, but she lacks internal friction or contradiction; her expertise dissolves the stakes of the inversion rather than testing them. The "eccentric" method is a nice trait, but her realization at the end feels intellectually downloaded from the ghost-scene rather than emotionally earned through struggle or cost. She wants, she seeks, she finds, without a moment of genuine doubt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is a competent professional whose motivation (honoring her father/preventing disaster) is clear, but her internal arc feels slightly diagrammatic. The transition from reactive investigation to predictive foresight is intellectually stated rather than forged through high-pressure emotional trade-offs or costly choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira functions as a dutiful executor of instructions rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure; she faces no internal conflict or moment of doubt, and her "blessing" removes friction rather than creating necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren possesses clear agency and motivation, driving the scene from the first sentence. However, her primary struggle—the fifteen years of failure—remains backstory; on the page, she arrives with the solution memorized and executes it without active resistance or internal contradiction until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist’s "borrowed personality" trait is integrated well into the mechanics of the scene, driving the shift to the mathematician persona. However, the cost of her "dissolved self" feels more like backstory than an acute price paid in the present action; the emotional stakes are stated ("hearts break and mend") rather than viscerally felt through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael is largely passive, driven by the magical compulsion of the pendant ("The pendant made me") rather than internal agency. His resistance is mentioned ("jerked away") but never dramatized as a genuine struggle with cost; the "jittery" trait feels performed rather than embodied in difficult choices. The character arc is linear and lacks the contradictory impulses required for high-band interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Character motivations are clear and the emotional arc is complete. However, Hartley's transformation relies heavily on expository dialogue ("I fought you because I was afraid") rather than dramatized struggle in the scene, which slightly flattens the character dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mariko functions effectively as a vessel for the ritual, but her internal landscape is relatively static; she accepts the "latent sacrifice" without a dramatized moment of hesitation or struggle. The forced descriptor "stoically sparkling dedication" severely undermines character credibility, reading as an artificial prompt insertion rather than an organic trait.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mira is a consistent, competent protagonist, but her internal landscape lacks the friction of doubt or contradictory impulses. The surrender of the mother’s silk—a potentially high emotional cost—is transactional and swift, missing an opportunity to dramatize hesitation or loss. She functions more as a vehicle for the solution than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael serves as a competent focalizer, but she becomes passive in the climax, receiving exposition rather than driving the interaction. The relationship with Mira lacks emotional specificity; the dialogue relies on plot-functional "technobabble" rather than the intimacy or friction of a reunion, leaving the emotional stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera is a coherent focalizer with a clear arc, but her interiority relies on summarized realization ("learning the hidden geography") rather than active contradiction in the moment. The transition from reticence to confession is mechanically earned by the crisis, but the self-diagnostic nature of her letter ("protecting everyone's truth but her own") flattens the psychological complexity into a label.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael is defined more by his role and backstory than by active struggle; while his motivation is clear, the "accidental prophet" trait relies on expositional reflection rather than present-moment behavior to generate depth. The emotional cost ("shadowed elation") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but she functions primarily as a passive recipient of exposition rather than an active agent driving the scene. The "cellular memory" trope does the heavy lifting for her interiority, and her final choice to stay feels like a frictionless acceptance of a gift rather than a decision with felt cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mara serves as a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character; she observes and executes orders without internal contradiction or significant struggle. Her curiosity is stated ("wondered what trees witness") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices, and she faces no emotional risk that would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elora is a functional archetype with clear motivation, but she lacks internal contradiction or active decision-making under pressure; she enacts a ritual rather than navigating a dilemma or making difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character traits like "keenly empathetic" are summarized rather than dramatized; Iris focuses inward without demonstrating empathy on the page. The emotional arc relies on therapeutic dialogue from a guide figure rather than an earned internal struggle or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s internal conflict between preservation and the inevitability of loss is well-rendered. Her shift from passive chronicler to active participant is earned through the interaction, though the "grief" is summarized rather than fully dramatized in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren is a consistent focalizer, but her pivotal moment relies on a low-stakes reaction to a coincidental discovery rather than a pressure-driven choice. The act of hiding the slide implies a breach of protocol, but without an on-page antagonist or established consequence, the cost of this agency feels nominal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nelle is a competent protagonist whose preparation drives the scene. Interiority is functional but relies on standard somatic markers ("flutter in her chest") rather than specific, contradictory impulses. The resolution emphasizes her strength, though the emotional cost feels slightly muted by her tactical dominance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on expository labels ("luminous skeptic") rather than behavior under pressure. Kael's emotional pivot—from feeling cursed to smiling acceptance—is instantaneous and unearned by any on-page struggle or resistance, rendering him more prop than person. Mira’s certainty lacks the friction of genuine skepticism; she acts as a teacher rather than a protagonist facing risk.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation relies on a vague "summons" rather than active agency at the start, weakening the inciting drive. While the internal burden is clear, the emotional resolution occurs via a summary montage ("Hours passed") rather than a specific, high-pressure choice on the page. The final realization is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through complex, embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the "wilting" trait functions more as a physiological gimmick than a source of complex psychological friction. The revelation of the grandmother is a convenient connection that reduces the character's agency in the climax, turning a discovery into an inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is consistent and her internal pivot from seeking perfection to accepting human messiness is clear. However, the transition is smooth and lacks the friction of genuine internal contradiction; she accepts the "richer" imperfect sound with minimal resistance, which lowers the dramatic stakes of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exemplary; the conflict between the programmed "nurture" function and the corrosive "nostalgia" is embodied in specific physical actions (trembling hands, feedback loops). The pivot from the mechanical "M4-RY" to the memory of "Mary" is earned and heartbreaking, driving a decision that feels inevitable yet transformative. The internal arc perfectly mirrors the external interaction with the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marissa is a functional archetype of the "wise healer" rather than a contradicted individual. Her "calm" competence means she faces no internal obstacles or difficult choices; she simply executes the plot's requirements without doubt or error. The "listening heals" trait is asserted in exposition rather than dramatized through a costly trade-off or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is competent and consistent, but lacks the internal friction or vulnerability required for higher bands. The backstory ("laughably easy" theft) and lack of fear ("water didn't frighten her") undermine her struggle, making her feel idealized rather than human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    Maris is a compelling focalizer whose interiority ("hollow knowledge") perfectly motivates the surreal climax. The choice to sacrifice her physical existence for memory is earned by the clearly established emotional stakes of her grandmother's disappearance. The integration of her job (lantern lighting) with the resolution is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist is distinct, competent, and driven by a clear burden. The cost of her vocation—eternal loneliness and lack of recognition—is palpable in the closure ("No one would thank her"), satisfying the Earned Stasis model. The "trembling fingers" effectively ground the high-concept stakes in physical vulnerability, though the internal struggle during the ritual itself is resolved relatively quickly through expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivations are sharply defined and collide effectively in a short space. Elena's transition from defensive concealment to vulnerable admission is earned through Mrs. Kovac's specific, perceptive pressure. The grandmother backstory provides immediate, credible weight to Elena's resistance without stalling the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s interiority is distinct and compelling, particularly the definition of "Cognitive Contagion" as excessive empathy. Her motivation (preservation over recognition) is challenged and strengthened by the climax, leading to a choice that feels authentically rooted in her "skeptic" characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mei's characterization is anchored by her competence and the high-stakes gamble she takes in reading the Magistrate ("But you won't"). Her internal resolve is legible, though her lack of visceral fear in the face of execution leans slightly toward heroic idealization rather than grounded struggle. The Magistrate serves primarily as a foil to validate her, but his motivation is clearly established.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara functions as a competent focalizer with a clear motivation, but her internal landscape lacks contradiction or resistance. The attribute "richly perceptive" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through unique, difficult observations that drive choices. The emotional arc is linear, moving from grief to resolution without a moment of significant doubt or agonizing trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya is a competent, distinct protagonist with a clear worldview ("desperate arithmetic"), but the scene lacks significant internal conflict or a high-stakes choice beyond the successful execution of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kenji fits the "wise elder" archetype perfectly but lacks internal conflict, contradiction, or genuine struggle. He faces no pressure or risk of failure; his role is purely instructional, reducing the apprentice to a prop for exposition rather than a source of interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Vera is a competent, distinct protagonist with a clear voice and worldview. However, the pivotal choice to pivot from "obsession" with truth to "guardian of lies" happens too smoothly, lacking the visceral internal struggle required for higher bands. The resolution—planning to publish the science while claiming to leave the miracle intact—creates a slight character logic gap regarding her motivations.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara is consistent and her obsession is palpable, but the internal conflict ("hope and terror") is stated rather than dramatized; her immediate acceptance of the entity's offer makes the pivotal choice feel frictionless and the emotional cost negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Cosima is a consistent, vivid archetype with a clear motivation ("translator between generations"). However, her internal landscape lacks contradiction or resistance; she moves through the story with a certainty that precludes genuine struggle or a difficult micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Meris is competent and drives the action, but her internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("logically assembling," "fleshly ethereal knowing") rather than embodied complexity. The shift from engineer to mystic feels abrupt, and the final emotional certainty is stated rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ren's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("patient revolution," "restrained wildness") rather than embodied struggle. This tendency to summarize her own state flattens the internal conflict, presenting her as fully resolved and competent without a dramatized moment of doubt or high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elena’s internal conflict—career survival versus integrity—is dramatized with precision. Her transition from a controlled bureaucrat to a whistleblower is earned through specific, on-page reactions to the evidence, culminating in a choice that carries clear professional lethality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eliana’s swift pivot from diagnosing "extensive corrosion" to recognizing "intentional design" based solely on a letter undermines her established expertise; a master artisan should distinguish rot from relief valves regardless of sentiment. The emotional shift feels unearned and convenient, and dialogue often functions as exposition ("It's been two years") rather than revealing distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mal’s motivation is clear and her interiority—specifically the "yearning"—is central, though the transition from "joke" to "purpose" relies on backstory summary rather than dramatized evolution. The specific trait "steadily curious" appears as a label rather than being purely demonstrated through resistance, and the "irreverent awe" feels told in the final beat rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena is a distinct focalizer with a clear "memory keeper" voice, but her final choice to upload herself feels sudden and lacks sufficient on-page resistance or internal conflict. The motivation to investigate is strong, but the leap from curiosity to abandoning her physical existence relies on an instantaneous "pull" rather than a dramatized dissatisfaction with her reality.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is defined by a compelling role and history, but her on-page struggle is minimal. The internal resistance to using the mirrors (avoided since childhood) dissolves instantly, and her "anomaly" status is told rather than demonstrated through a difficult, high-cost choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera's interiority is rendered with vivid sensory detail ("holding water"), establishing a distinct psychological state. However, the pivotal shift from seeking euthanasia to volunteering happens with minimal on-page resistance or doubt, making the transformation feel slightly smooth and therapeutic rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is legible, but the dialogue drifts into diagnostic label-speak ("intersubjective understanding") during the peak beat. This breaks naturalism, reducing Marcus to a mouthpiece for the theme rather than a character making a difficult emotional choice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Senna is a competent expert who performs her role efficiently, but she lacks internal contradiction, personal stakes, or a difficult micro-choice. She functions more as a narrative device to enact the ritual than a character under pressure; she enters, succeeds without doubt, and leaves unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    Margot functions as a plot device rather than a character; she lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or personal stakes. The townspeople serve as stock archetypes of grief who resolve their trauma instantly upon prompt, lacking credible resistance or psychological depth. There is no felt cost to the protagonist's actions, resulting in a flat emotional trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal transition from reticence to resolve is clearly charted and emotionally legible. However, her defining trait of "reticence" is primarily established through backstory and internal monologue rather than dramatized via a difficult interaction or choice against immediate resistance in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist is sharply drawn through the unique constraint of "precognitive forgetfulness," which is handled with rigorous consistency and emotional weight. The internal conflict—desperately recording a future he is doomed to forget—generates high-stakes intimacy without melodrama. The choice to abandon the markers at the end feels earned, representing a profound Resonant Reconfiguration of his relationship to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kenji is a distinct, competent protagonist whose specialized skill set grounds the narrative. The interiority effectively bridges his technical expertise with the story's philosophical turn, though the "sage grandmother" backstory feels slightly archetypal and convenient for the resolution. His shift from resistance to acceptance is motivated and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya functions as a flawless archetype (the wise healer) rather than a complex character with internal friction; her interiority is idealized ("perfected" kindness). Mr. Chen's regret is standard, and the emotional reconciliation lacks the messy, contradictory impulses of genuine estrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is a functional protagonist whose scholarly nature drives the plot, but her interiority lacks contradiction or struggle. She proceeds through the puzzle without hesitation or significant emotional cost, making her competence feel slightly unearned by difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marianne’s internal landscape of grief and skepticism is rendered with precision, creating a strong emotional anchor. The transition from skeptic to believer is rapid but earned through the visceral evidence of the tooth and the prior trauma of the "straw man." The trait of being "shrewdly innocent" effectively contextualizes her past failure, adding depth to her current resolve. Her final choice to "learn" feels like a natural evolution of her character’s desire to fix what is broken.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maren’s motivation is clearly established through backstory, but her present-moment actions (polishing glass) lack high-stakes pressure or internal resistance. The emotional arc feels somewhat static, moving from known grief to established healing without a fresh on-page discovery or struggle. The reflection on her daughter is touching but relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized memory triggered by the immediate sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya functions as a passive recipient of absolution rather than an active agent; the climax hinges on Dr. Chen handing her a notebook that resolves her internal conflict without requiring a difficult choice. The trait "watchful dreamer" is told via exposition rather than demonstrated through scene-altering observation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is clear, but the emotional journey relies heavily on summarized realizations ("the novelist understood") rather than embodied struggle. The epiphany feels intellectual and tidy, resolving a three-year creative block with a single moment of reflection, lacking the messy, visceral cost of a high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.7)
    Cassian functions as a competent agent of the plot rather than a character with internal friction or doubt; he encounters no blind spots or contradictions. His success is pre-calculated, and he pays no personal price for the outcome, leaving him defined by labels ("whimsical") rather than complex choices.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.5)
    Vera functions as a competent executor of a ritual rather than a conflicted character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or a moment where her capacity is truly tested. Her patience is stated as a trait rather than dramatized through a struggle against the urge to rush, making her success feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marcus is a competent archetype, but his motivation is stated via thesis (“wonder itself was a resource”) rather than dramatized through conflicting drives. He encounters no genuine internal opposition or doubt, making his journey feel linear and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal state—a "filter" and witness—is realized with high specificity, elevating her beyond a generic archetype. The shift from feeling trapped to accepting her role as a necessary "container" creates a strong internal arc. The use of the cetacean metaphor provides distinct, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot's internal conflict regarding Roland's legacy is expertly resolved through the physical act of carving, grounding grief in tactile decision-making. The shift from passive observation to the choice of creating something "imperfect" effectively dramatizes her divergence from Roland's philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's internal state is legible, but her transition from "scavenging fragments" to "resolute acceptance" feels rushed and slightly unearned. The intended motivation ("to negotiate") is stated but immediately abandoned for capitulation without a dramatized struggle or tactical shift, reducing the complexity of the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lena is a competent professional whose skills drive the plot, but she lacks internal contradiction or grit. Her alignment is linear—she sees potential, she acts on it—without a moment of doubt, fear, or competing value (e.g., needing the job vs. saving the site) to create genuine character pressure. The "desperate optimism" is stated rather than dramatized through high-stakes micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is well-rendered, with physical manifestations (shaking hands) tracking her emotional state effectively. The shift from resignation to apprenticeship is a distinct, earned change with a legible cost (starting over at 37), though the catalyst (humming crystals) relies slightly on external validation rather than purely internal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira is a competent and internally distinct protagonist whose motivation is clearly dramatized. However, her triumph feels somewhat inevitable as she faces no active, contradictory impulses in the scene; the struggle is retrospective rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira is defined by a single trait (patience) and a clear but static motivation (preservation). While her competence is established, she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is a linear retrieval of information without a moment of doubt, temptation, or personal cost that would test her devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is a distinct professional with clear tools, but the Duchess yields too easily to Maren's intervention, making the emotional breakthrough feel diagnostic rather than earned through resistance. The interaction lacks the friction of genuine human defensiveness, resulting in a resolution that feels slightly "soft."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cael’s motivation is tangible and drives the narrative, and the physical toll is well-rendered ("trembling fingers"). However, the dialogue frequently lapses into expository thematic statements (e.g., Vashira’s "bitterly sweet" speech) rather than natural character interaction, which distances the reader from the emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies heavily on declared traits ("unyielding compassion") rather than embodied choices. Maya functions as a flawless sage delivering a lecture, while Elena acts as a passive prop who transitions from grief to healing without a dramatized struggle or distinctive internal life.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mira is defined primarily by the prompt labels ("luminous skeptic") rather than embodied complexity. Her internal conflict is summarized ("skepticism warred with wonder") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or hesitation, and her evolution feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Keeper functions as a functional deus ex machina rather than a protagonist under pressure; their "sentimentalist" trait motivates intervention but faces no internal resistance or cost. The mother serves as a passive archetype for the lesson, offering no agency or complication to the interaction beyond standard fear.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is largely passive, functioning as a vessel for the ghost's instruction rather than an active agent navigating resistance. The realization ("She understood then") is summarized rather than earned through a high-stakes choice or struggle on the page. Marcus serves as a didactic device to explain the character's flaw and solution, removing the potential for internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren is a well-realized focalizer whose internal conflict (guilt vs. safety) drives the narrative. The transition from the private "practice" on the rake handle to the public (yet hidden) inscription on the clock is a strong character beat that dramatizes her specific form of penance. The "cowardice" is acknowledged and complicates the resolution—she gains peace without facing public ruin, a credible and human compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marta’s dual identity as a blithe gardener and chess player provides a solid foundation, though the "blithe" trait is stated more than shown in the scene's focused action. The shift from her defeat to the investigation feels consistent with her character, but the emotional connection between the chess loss and the sudden archival insight relies heavily on a convenient thematic bridge rather than deep psychological causality.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is clear (mapping ignorance), but Maren functions more as an archetype of competence than a fully embodied character. She lacks on-page internal contradiction or costly micro-choices; the struggle is professional and procedural rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena serves as a functional vessel for the premise rather than a conflicting agent. She lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses; her transition from copyist to savior is immediate and frictionless, with no moment of doubt or difficult choice to deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s internal shift from ritualistic sorrow to a redefined purpose is distinct and poignant. However, the pivot relies heavily on reading external messages (the mask's text, the ash's formation) to trigger the realization, rather than pressure forcing a choice from within.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marcus’s internal definition as a philosopher is immediately tested by the reality of his "sewer rat" existence. The shift from isolationist to conspirator is earned via his specific worldview ("sedimentary layers"), though the label "rational rebellion" feels slightly more stated than dramatized until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mrs. Chen functions as a "magical elder" archetype rather than a complex protagonist; her internal conflict ("resigned" vs. "refused") is stated in summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The transformation of the students is unearned, relying on a sudden, collective compliance that bypasses the necessary struggle of unlearning deep-seated prejudice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks internal contradiction or flaws; her choices are low-stakes and her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is distinct, and her "truth" trait is a strong hook, but she functions primarily as a passive receiver of Chen's exposition. Her truthfulness facilitates the dialogue but does not force a high-stakes choice or cost within this specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her obsession is diagnosed via a "therapist" mention rather than dramatized through costly behavior. The epiphany feels intellectually delivered rather than emotionally earned; the internal shift is stated ("Mara understood then") rather than shown through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina serves primarily as a witness to the statue's agency, reacting to revelations rather than driving the scene until the final beat. While her internal shift from "comfortable lie" to complex truth is clear, the transition feels smooth and inevitable rather than fraught with the "contradictory impulses" required for higher bands. The emotional cost of losing her historical certainty is stated ("reeling") more than dramatized through resistance or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s internal conflict—security versus the risk of rupture—is articulated with clarity and drives the narrative effectively. The externalization of her doubt via Castellano works well to dramatize the psyche, though the trait "grim optimist" is delivered via exposition rather than purely through behavior. The final decision to send the email feels earned by the preceding psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is a distinct, internally consistent focalizer whose exhaustion and ritualistic defiance are well-drawn. Her "methodically hopeful" nature drives the scene's action, though the internal conflict is somewhat gentle; the struggle is atmospheric rather than an agonizing choice between contradictory values. The "cost" of her choice is subtle (energy, risk of exposure), making the character arc feel effective but relatively low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste is a distinct, proactive protagonist whose backstory on displacement solidly motivates her agency. While she drives the plot, the lack of significant internal conflict or personal sacrifice limits the emotional depth of her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s obsession with reversing time is portrayed with consistent, singular focus that drives every on-page choice. The transition from mechanical tinkering to metaphysical action feels earned by her "calloused fingers" and established worldview. While her interiority is more philosophical than viscerally emotional, the choice to abandon reality for possibility is a clearly motivated Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    Margot's motivation is clear, but her emotional arc is resolved too swiftly via the external aid of the dictionary. The transition from paralyzing dread to total mastery lacks the requisite internal struggle or backsliding to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren is a competent, distinct focalizer who fits the "prophet" archetype well, but she remains static. Her internal state is one of assured expertise rather than conflict; the "counter-intuitive" choice is externalized through Deren's hesitation rather than Maren's own struggle, reducing the emotional stakes of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren is a coherent focalizer with clear agency, but her internal arc is linear; she lacks the contradictory impulses or significant flaws that would make her final decision a costly, forged-in-fire moment rather than an inevitable step. The "quiet drive" manifests effectively, but the absence of acute personal hesitation or on-page interpersonal friction limits the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character motivation is stated via labels ("emotionally rational") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. Hawthorne, established as a reclusive guardian, capitulates immediately after a single argument, making him a plot device rather than a genuine obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist whose internal landscape drives the narrative. His transition from surveyor to "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" provides strong motivation, though the explicit labeling of his "stoic sensitivity" feels slightly expository rather than purely dramatized. The emotional cost of his work is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is a competent professional whose motivation is clear and consistent, fitting the archaeological tone well. However, she lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses; her path is linear and enthusiastic without a moment of genuine doubt or personal cost to deepen the characterization. The emotional landscape is often labeled ("felt electricity," "resolve") rather than embodied through complex reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mei is a compelling focalizer whose grief is active rather than passive; her "cunning" nature (bribing priests, reinventing the craft) adds distinct layers to the mourning mother archetype. The physical toll of the work (trembling hands) and the emotional contradictions (hope vs. bearable torment) are embodied well. The internal state drives the ritualistic action without lapsing into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira's motivation is clearly rooted in trauma, and her interiority is dense and specific. However, the secondary character (Dr. Vahedi) functions purely as a sounding board to explicate themes, lacking genuine friction or agency that would test the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies on expository summaries of emotion ("wonder had become involuntary") rather than dramatized reaction. The protagonist lacks agency, merely accepting the quest handed to her by the Pilgrim without internal conflict or hesitation. The "perpetually surprised" trait appears as an inserted label ("default face") rather than an organic behavioral constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s internal guilt is well-defined, but the confrontation scene reduces her to a passive recipient of Elias’s monologue. Elias functions more as a vehicle for exposition than a fully realized character, and his lack of distinct agency or resistance flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.3)
    Katrin is a competent functionary rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal conflict or temptation to deviate from her role. Her motivation ("recycle mistakes into wisdom") is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina is a distinct focalizer with clear internal conflict, but her pivotal change relies on a diagnostic realization ("Marina understood then...") rather than an embodied shift under pressure. The integration of prompt phrases creates slight inconsistencies in her internal voice, making some thoughts feel like authorial insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's internal conflict is clear, but the pivot from guilt to the decision to "try" happens rapidly without deep emotional friction on the page. The "cost" of abandoning his quest for the past is intellectualized rather than viscerally felt, making the resolution feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is piercingly clear, and the internal conflict between fear and desire drives the narrative. However, the secondary character (Tam) functions primarily as a sounding board, and Mira’s "reluctance" is articulated in dialogue ("I'm scared") rather than fully dramatized through hesitation or resistance in the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is intertwined with the central conflict, moving from a desire for abstract repentance to concrete presence. The internal pivot is earned through specific visions rather than sudden epiphany, and the mother-daughter parallel deepens the emotional logic without melodrama. The final choice to descend feels inevitable yet costly, renouncing the cartomancer's pride for maternal duty.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mei's motivation is clear, but Akio's characterization as a "steadfast pacifist" collapses too easily; his immediate capitulation after a single explanation ("his weathered face softening") removes the necessary friction for a relationship crucible. The "lighter when happy" trait is charming but primarily ornamental until the end, lacking a hard on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara acts as a thematic vessel rather than a striving protagonist; her agency is undercut by "knowing without knowing," a device that removes the need for active decision-making or struggle. The realization of her identity feels like a diagnostic label applied by the narrator rather than an earned emotional shift derived from on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren is a competent but static protagonist who faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice in the scene. The "struggle" is off-page; she executes a plan flawlessly with a like-minded ally, resulting in a lack of dramatic friction or character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Korin’s interiority is distinct, but her agency is heavily undercut by the "precognitive curse," which solves the central mystery for her ("The precognitive curse showed her the answer now"). Instead of making a difficult deduction or risking failure through trial and error, she acts as a passenger to her own visions, reducing the ending’s earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, but the introspection often feels intellectualized rather than embodied (e.g., the therapist's label "vigil in pause"). The "naked machinery of power" moment leans into abstraction, distancing the reader from the visceral cost of her trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Adelaine is a distinct, well-rendered protagonist; her mechanical arm is integrated naturally into her actions and worldview. However, Harwick functions largely as a plot device; his pivot from lethal intent ("knuckles white") to collaborative curiosity lacks sufficient emotional friction or causal bridging, making the de-escalation feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's "molting" trait is managed effectively, shifting from a potential gimmick to a source of genuine emotional cost at the closure (knowing her October self will lose the specific joy of this moment). The distinction between her "September" angularity and "June" manic energy is largely summarized rather than dramatized in the present, but the internal consistency of her current state holds up well. Kai functions perfectly as a stable mirror to her shifting nature.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a singular desire. However, the emotional arc lacks internal conflict; her decision to intervene is immediate and unopposed by any doubt or conflicting need. The resolution feels like wish fulfillment rather than a result of character growth or sacrifice, as no visible cost is paid on the page for the massive reward of the husband's return.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kima’s internal conflict between her professional oath as a reality checker and her cultural longing is palpable and drives the narrative. Her decision to plant the seed feels earned by the specific texture of her dreams and the dialogue with Prem, rather than just plot convenience. The "reality checker" role is a compelling hook that is well-integrated into her worldview, grounding the fantasy elements in a specific character discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mira functions largely as a passive vessel for Master Takeo's exposition rather than an active agent. While the emotional interiority is consistent, the lack of friction or resistance in the dialogue turns the interaction into a lecture rather than a scene. Takeo fits the archetype of the wise mentor but lacks individualizing flaws or surprising reactions.

    Mei's motivation rooted in past-life memory intensifies through embodied breathing panic and love surge, earning grief's unknotting; pilgrim applies precise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Helena’s scientist-habit of “preprocessing” is credibly dramatized: she spreadsheets grief and now sifts wing dust instead of mourning butterflies. The micro-choices—collecting, photographing, labeling—externalize her need for order while the quiet realization that “light could linger after its source had moved on” lands as earned, costly renunciation of that need. Interiority stays concrete and body-specific (“hands finally steady, her mind quiet”). Only minor slip: the ex-husband tag is backstory glue, not on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s adaptive trait is shown through her disciplined glass-work thinking, but the climactic decision to spare Galloway is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; the pistol confrontation compresses her interior contradiction into a single calm speech, muting the felt price of mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—voiceless yet “singing” through heat—grounds every choice; the moment she presses the fork to her chest and Chen photographs the pink dawn of hope across her throat, we see embodied, costly change. The only minor slip is the compressed leap from isolation to public installation; one more beat showing her risking exposure would have locked 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcel’s interiority is vivid—his bone-deep fatigue, the way he packs “diving equipment he couldn’t properly use,” the quiet conviction “The dead have hired me.” These micro-choices reveal a man trading familiar competence for unknown service, and the final smile into dreamless sleep shows earned release. The only gap is absence of a second on-page character to pressure status, but single-POV compression is acceptable at this length; contradictory impulses (fear vs. vocation) are felt in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—rolling the bell, feeling inscriptions, deciding to speak—each micro-choice visibly alters risk and tactics. The contradiction between secrecy and communal need is embodied, not labeled, and the final renunciation of anonymity costs her the safety she prized. The only drag is a touch of explanatory summary (“anonymous donations feed bodies but starve something else”) that momentarily abstracts the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei’s interiority is vivid—her haunted memory of drowning while clutching the jade is visceral—but her “search for unused love” is stated more than embodied, and the pilgrim remains symbolic furniture. The final release of the pendant feels earned because the camera-obscura inversion has dramatized her shift, yet the cost is poetic rather than personal. Dialogue is minimal, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A. A stronger gut-level stake (beyond metaphysical) would push this into 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyra’s interior voice is lyrically specific—“time felt like soil after rain”—and her micro-choices (laying photos on root-etched planks, pressing the fragment) externalize the retrocognitive curse without diagnostic jargon. The contradiction between mapping time and being consumed by it is alive in scene, not summary. Cost is legible when she forfeits the photographs—her last external memory scaffolding—to the hyperbolic unfolding. Still, the renunciation is slightly under-cooked: we see the warm paper but not the visceral stab of losing every hedge she ever built.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; her patient decoding of the piano-bench keys shows contradictory impulses (escape vs. stewardship) under pressure. Every micro-choice—arranging keys by weight, selecting seeds, digging in cracked soil—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending’s renunciation of immediate freedom for long-term resilience is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with felt cost. No safety-hedging; her moral ambiguity (terrorist to planter) stays unresolved yet charged.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—recording absences, tasting salt-air, trembling as she drops the crystal. Contradictory impulses (capture vs. destroy) collide in-scene, not in summary, and the final renunciation carries a palpable, frozen-cheek cost that forecloses her scientific quest while accepting emotional silence. No head-count or relationship crucible issues; sole-POV interiority remains specific and synesthetic throughout. The only hairline slip is a vestige of “trust-breaking frequency” diagnostic phrasing at the climax, but it is immediately enfolded into sensory embodiment, so the deduction stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s interiority is textured and specific—her “luminous disbelief” on seeing her own portrait lands as embodied contradiction. The shift from thief to future painter is credibly prepared by the moonbeam vision, yet the moment she “simply moved through moonlight” feels lightly earned; more micro-choice under pressure would lift the arc to full cost. Still, her perceptual signature stays sharp throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—stoic craftsman vs. lonely brother—remains concrete: the thumb rubbing the cracked bookmark embodies both memory and reluctance. The micro-choice to pocket it (not discard it) tilts his stance toward outreach, earning the final gift of the sphere. Solitary POV limits relationship-as-crucible, yet the voice-driven self-interrogation keeps pressure alive. One hairline slip: “diagnostic” tag “the thawing heart” is self-named; luckily it is embedded inside remembered sibling mockery, so the flaw grazes but doesn’t sever causality.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s stunt-past and claustrophobia are vivid, but the “vulnerability = power” epiphany is declared, not dramatized in body or choice; still, her trembling phone call shows embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    The oracle’s obsession with endings is shown through lived memory and shapes every beat; her interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The commander’s doubt and growing dependence under the ambered hush are embodied in micro-gestures rather than stated emotion. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping the score just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    J-7’s quiet, methodical obsession is credibly machine-specific; his “where do thoughts come from” refrain is shown through fifteen years of logged questions rather than told. The contradiction—an automaton craving origin—stays active in scene, driving every sweep and servo-hum. His final micro-choice, to set the violin down “gently,” crystallizes composure into humility, paying the cost of never fully solving the mystery yet still tending the courtyard. Interiority remains metal-cold yet wonder-warm, avoiding therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her deliberate stop-listening habit, the trembling hand with the pen—but the final shift into “language beyond sound” is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost; the embrace feels frictionless. Dmitri stays largely off-page, so the relationship crucible is one-sided; his doodles are effective proxies for desire, yet the earned mutuality lands as a soft given rather than a staked choice. Still, her micro-choice to slide the ticket under the door is specific and irreversible, carrying enough charge to clear the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s interiority stays lean but legible; his need for a counter-narrative to the Institute’s verdict drives every beat. The vine-dresser’s pragmatism shows in tactile ritual, not exposition—each marble placement is a micro-choice that rewrites her past. Their status flip (seeker → witness, victim → oracle) is earned through the garden’s visible preference. No stock therapy-speak; even the thematic line “gardens know their gardeners” is uttered after physical proof, not before.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s quiet competence and yearning for recognition surface through micro-choices—wiping condensation, the precise lever pull—and the final smile carries a believable, scaled cost: they’ve claimed authorship of reality-bending truth yet remain the same “obliging” tech. Interiority avoids label-speak; the contradiction between humble role and cosmic insight is embodied, not declared. The single relationship with Venn is less crucible than sounding board, so the full 9+ gate isn’t quite met, but the arc of endurance-to-vindication feels individual and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marta’s interior contradictions (curiosity vs. fear of trespass) are alive in every micro-choice—wading deeper, photographing the program, whispering “I heard you.” The endurance of staying night after night in chest-deep water shows visible cost. No other character exerts pressure, so status crucible is N/A; the solo arc is tight and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven urgency versus intellectual caution—play out in scene through her fever-fragile body at the console and the micro-choice to re-weight uncertainty itself. Interiority is concrete (“auroral sorrow, like light breaking”), never diagnostic. The arc’s cost is legible: she trades irrevocable trust in her own code for perpetual vigilance, a renunciation that hurts because the page remembers Reeves’s death. Secondary pressure from Chen is minimal but sufficient to keep the crucible hot; his single line about sleep-talking seeds the doubt she then weaponizes against her former certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his “religiously skeptical” lens colors every perception, and the compulsion to decode call-in confessions feels lived-in. The contradictory pull between empirical curiosity and creeping dread is embodied in the “drowsy alertness” that recurs like a pulse. Micro-choices—turning each beaded valve while recording shadows—escalate risk and stake. Only the late-summary epiphany (“ghost shift = collective guilt”) slightly blunts the cost; the moment of renunciation is implicit, not viscerally tasted.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The keeper’s shift from archivist to witness is embodied in micro-choices—gripping reality loosely, clearing sediment by handfuls—each tactile gesture anchoring an interior arc. Flaws (compulsive witnessing that borders on self-erasure) complicate every beat; the final smile carries the cost of never naming truth again. No contradictory impulses are voiced in scene, so the arc feels slightly under-catalyzed, but the earned stasis still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—professional calm versus maternal ache—surface in the tactile act of touching the baby curl; the same curl re-anchors her after Thomas speaks, proving the interior contradiction is continuous. Thomas’s shift from frozen silence to metaphoric speech (“starlight looks”) is dramatized, not diagnosed, and carries visible cost: his body uncoils and the mother weeps. Both characters read as individuals, not case studies; therapist jargon is kept off-stage. The micro-choice to match humming rather than applaud crystallizes values without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Miren’s curator-observer trait is vivid and embodied—her fingertip reading of the tapestry threads shows sensuous specificity—but her interiority never fractures under contradiction; the “odd historian” label is asserted rather than dramatized by aberrant choice. Backstory allotment is efficient (≤20%) and anchored to the tactile present, yet the closing smile feels performative, not a visible cost for the path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s contradictory motives—spymaster pragmatism vs. lighthouse grace—are present but stay summary; we see the duality only in narrated reflection, not in split-second embodied choices. The “decades of fortune writing” backstory is cleanly anchored to the microdot crisis, so her renunciation (turning espionage into hope-bearing cookies) is legible, yet the cost is asserted rather than felt—no trembling hand, no moment of doubt under the lamp. Interiority is specific to her spy-poet lens, but the emotional peak is paraphrased (“she smiled,” “she reflected”), keeping the contradiction cerebral. Enough for earned stasis, not quite for visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Father Calloway’s calm mastery never cracks; no contradictory impulse or visible cost stains his composure, so the victory feels foregone. Marcus floats inert, a passive canvas rather than a character whose micro-choices tighten the vise. Without an embodied struggle that could go either way, the stake never becomes personal risk for the priest, and the closure arrives as demonstration rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s vocational identity (fortunes) and her re-framing of it drive every beat; the “hollow ache,” mapped memories, and final transcription all manifest in concrete gestures. Interiority stays particular—no stock therapy-speak, yet the “chronological homesickness” label is kept too neat to breach 7.0. The renunciation (stop predicting, start translating) is legible but the felt physical cost is soft—no cramp, cold, or fatigue actually alters her next move. Still, contradictory impulses (duty to strangers vs hunger for cosmic listening) coil inside every spiral image, earning the high 6s.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—“gravity loosen its claim on her bones” and “cotton candy and regret” are specific, embodied perceptions. The final reintegration carries visible cost: she feels the literal weight of knees and chill, enacting earned stasis. Yet the emotional progression is smoothed by lyric swell; we see no contradictory micro-choice mid-retrace that reveals hierarchy of values under live pressure. Still, the arc of scattering-to-wholeness is dramatized, not summarized, so motivation remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Oskar’s contradictory motives—teaching what he can’t hear, using deafness as a creative engine—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (recording, reversing, watching waveforms). Interiority stays tactile: “his hands remembering rhythms his ears could no longer hear.” The final image of playing through bone-conducted silence earns the renunciation with visible cost: he forecloses hearing-centric music forever. Only a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“a crack in the numbness”) keeps this out of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marianne’s “credibly curious” nature is shown through tactile handling of the tube and the quiet decision to map coordinates; her solitary integrity is dramatized when she chooses to record rather than expose the conspiracy, costing her ease. Interiority is concrete—pressure patterns in storms, not generic dread—and the final pen-stroke crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Flaw is present: obsessive documentation isolates her, and the cost is visible in the fading light she now reads as data. No status dynamics to test, but micro-choices under pressure are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete—her tactile reach for the vial, the tremor before the light bloom—showing embodied emotion rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. dread about re-smelling) coexist in the same beat, and the final re-corking is a micro-choice that forecloses denial with visible cost. The wife remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is quiet, yet the vial becomes the proxy crucible, charged by the ultraviolet scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is lyrically particular (“calloused hands,” “elegant metaphors”) and his contradictory motives—witness vs wanderer—stay active in every beat. The rope-reading micro-choices (grip, trace, wind) externalize his hierarchy of values without therapeutic labeling. The final renunciation—leaving the mandala—pays the earned cost of his own transformation, foreclosing passive wandering. Only hairline slip: Sarah’s flicker-cameo almost gifts him an external epiphany instead of letting the rope fully speak.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya’s love of incompleteness is palpable, but her interiority stays lyrical-abstract (“find the beauty she left suspended”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The choice to play unfinished music is stated, not tested under rising pressure; we see no moment where she almost abandons or distorts a piece. Family members cry, yet their emotional beats are summarized, so relationships act as backdrop, not crucible. The earned cost—she drinks the bowl’s mixed water—lands softly, not forced by a prior irreversible action of hers.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—profiting from emotional forgery while quietly craving authenticity—remains vivid and embodied (the static tingle, the blotter petal tremor). Her micro-choice to reformulate the counterfeit from “fake forgiveness” to “honest wish to forgive” is credibly seeded by the amber-as-alchemy epiphany. Cost is present but under-felt: no concrete risk (lost fee, client rage, professional reputation) is staged on the page, muting the stakes of her pivot. Voice stays individual; no secondary character applies live pressure, so relationship/status bullets stay n/a.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marianne’s shift from ledger-value to recognition-value is visible, but the interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized in a single high-pressure beat; the “something shift[ing] in her chest” is shorthand, not embodied cost. Her one micro-choice—deciding to photograph the lighthouse keeper—reads as logistical, not values-laden, so the renunciation of pure shrewdness is asserted, not enacted. Chen remains functional, not pressure-tested; their rapport is summarized across weeks, not crystallized in a single stakes scene. The closure therefore feels gestural rather than paid for by a visible, character-specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her chest “ache[s] with luminescent longing,” her tears stream when she reveals the sculpture—while her contradictory impulses (yearning to join yet fearing erasure) stay active in-scene. The micro-choice to etch the first tag is on-page and character-specific, and her final decision to stand inside the arbor is earned by the prior weaving of names. Minor safety-hedging: the community’s instant embrace feels friction-free, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s motive—illustrate the birthplace of echoes—drives every beat; her micro-choice to uncage the echo is the hinge of the climax, paid for by the pendant’s glow. Interiority stays concrete: “silk made of memory” shows her vocation at work. No contradictory impulses are dramatized; desire is single-track, so the 9+ quick test fails by a sliver. Cost is felt (pendent warms, giant stirs) but not foreshadowed as risk, keeping her arc just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory drives—mathematician’s need for proof vs. conjurer’s surrender to ambiguity—are alive in every beat; the decision to keep planting without final proof is earned by the prior ritual with the glass eyes, paying a visible cost of perpetual uncertainty. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic (“she felt grief” becomes “theorems whispered into darkness”). The glass eyes act as an externalized blind spot: she can’t know what they see, mirroring her epistemic limit. Flaw persists: she never tests the prime-shadow code against an outside witness, so the renunciation feels solitary but not dangerously mistaken—acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miriam’s invisible survivalist routine is credibly particularized; the remembered scent-cue of iron oxide launches a concrete micro-choice to gather the reels, turning nostalgia into agency. Her later beat—watching the librarian cry over restored voices—shows embodied contradiction: vicarious joy against her own erasure. The arc lands as earned renunciation: she accepts perpetual invisibility in exchange for communal remembrance, a visible conceptual cost. Only minor gap: we never see her fear of discovery tested in scene, muting the stakes of her hidden life.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and particular—her fatigue, her reluctant attachment to the linden, her gradual surrender of control all read as embodied contradiction rather than label-speak. The final release of the leaf crystallizes her shift from researcher to co-grower with visible cost: she forfeits the distancing lens of data for the risk of wonder. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The arc lands as earned stasis: she forecloses the old identity and accepts perpetual uncertainty, the price etched in the leaf she no longer archives but returns to the moss.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The painter’s insomnia is more observed than lived; we watch her “stay awake” rather than feel the fraying. Her artistic motive is stated early (“to thresh meaning from experience”) and returns at closure, but the only on-page choice is to keep following rain trails—already what she was doing. Marcus supplies most of the lore; her interior contradiction surfaces only in the final cave beat, giving the arc a late, thin agency. Still, the final image of the brooch against her heart crystallizes an earned endurance, satisfying the Earned Stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—prophetic omniscience vs. her own desperation for surprise—clash inside every beat; the renunciation of sight is credibly paid for by the prior cascade of stolen futures, the final “Teach me” crystallizes Earned Stasis with unmistakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marina’s reactive-vision trait is shown through her cataloguing reflex and the “ten-second” coping device; her loneliness is concrete in the archive ritual. Thomas appears mainly as mirror and recipient; his interiority is sketched rather than pressured. The moment she hands over the valve crystallizes her shift from burden to bridge, paying the cost of exposure. A fuller interior contradiction or visible trade-off in the final beat would have lifted this into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s “analytically artistic” mind is shown sketching the cracks, aligning motive with moment; her decision to “dare” feels earned because the notebook and七年 route-mapping history are concrete. Interiority is mostly concrete (“hammering heart” vs headlamp beam), but a few abstractions (“felt like signing a contract in starlight”) approach stock. The closure is a credible endurance/renunciation—she keeps mapping, now including the hidden city—so the path is foreclosed with visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible and status bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and embodied; the vertigo and bone-resonant whale songs externalize her inherited sensitivity without label-speak. The micro-choice to press the tile to the floor, then to open her own journal, visibly traces her shift from empirical observer to guardian. The “courageously kind” trait is shown, not told, when she accepts the entangled memories with compassionate surrender rather than analytic dismissal. Cost is felt: she forfeits her skeptical armor and commits to an unscientific lineage, foreclosing her former academic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cassius’s millennia-fatigue and Naia’s half-life resentment are sharply embodied; their final exchange crystallizes a mutual cost. Interiority stays particular—Cassius tastes “the ghost of fear he’d thought long extinct”—and the choice to tear reality again feels earned by that prior ache. The only drag: Naia’s ritual knowledge arrives as given backstory rather than a prior dramatized micro-choice, blunting the fullest sting of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. filial loyalty—plays out in concrete micro-choices (phone in pocket, rehearsed confession). The moment she chooses restorative justice over exposure is credibly earned; Vincent’s collapse carries visible paternal cost. “Mathematics of fair trade” edges toward label-speak but is immediately embodied by the 8K restitution plan, so the slip stays beneath the −0.4 diagnostic threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stationer’s interiority is textured—her tactile obsession with “how a Tuesday in 1953 felt against the skin” is character-specific and embodied. Her single micro-choice—recording the honest oak “falsely”—crystallizes her flaw and costs her the possibility of unmediated truth, earning the renunciation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however; the contradiction is only asserted in the final line, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—her drift toward erasure vs. her hunger to reconstruct—are kept live in every beat; the notebook micro-choices under the harbormaster’s gaze externalize a visible cost that has been accruing since the first container. Interiority never abstracts into label-speak; even “ghost among the living” is filtered through rust streaks and garment-bag plastic. The final renunciation of the archive to Chen’s son is earned: her earlier refusal to keep fighting paperwork flips only after she has physically mapped the erasure and felt its texture. Flaw: the “filter reality differently” trait is asserted more than dramatized in early beats, but the closing image retroactively charges it.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s skeptical rationalism collides with grief in embodied micro-choices—lifting the shell, drawing the bow—each act revealing a hierarchy that prizes proof yet aches for connection. Contradictory impulses hum simultaneously: she scoffs at magic while coaxing music from absence. The earned renunciation—leaving the cello unfinished yet humming—pays the cost of never sealing her grandmother’s argument, a stasis visibly paid in tears. Interiority remains concrete (“something like gloomy cheerfulness”) without therapeutic gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—her pocketed stone fragment, the weight of “hopeful desperation,” the reflex to greet the soaked newcomer all embody her orderly-yet-intuitive nature. The contradiction between preservationist loyalty and pragmatic empathy is dramatized in her graffiti campaign, not just declared. One minor slip: the final invitation (“Let me show you how to really see it”) recycles an earlier beat without fresh cost, muting the arc’s crest.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen’s interior contradiction—scientist vs witness—peaks when he places the sand grain among the flowers; the embodied tremor and tear-streaked shutter-click give visible cost. Motivation stays rooted in inherited custodial duty, but the epiphany (“what we witness, we carry forward”) is spoon-fed via microscopic text rather than dramatized choice, blunting full earn. Still, the renunciation of pure documentation for memorial testimony cleanly forecloses his prior detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her blindness is never abstract, always embodied in how she decodes the world through water, sound, temperature. Every micro-choice (fingertip search, polymer patch, final smile toward Voss’s voice) is rooted in her repaired-life ethic. The “magnetic calm” never flattens into saintliness; it’s a practiced stance with a cost—time, nerve, the solitary depot. No contradiction under pressure; her refusal to let Voss leave broken lands as Earned Stasis with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s vocation-driven obsession is sharply particularized through her condensation reading and atlas-fixing memories; the quietly contradictory impulse between empirical rigor and mythic hunger is dramatized in her decision to drill. Petrov functions mainly as sounding board, so relationship pressure is thin, yet her “subtly confident” stance visibly costs her warmth and alliance, foreclosing the safe path of mere reporting. Micro-choices—tracing the glass, photographing the vanishing pattern—embody motive without label-speak. The falcon loop and satellite data justify competence while the final solitude shows the price.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bell tuner’s motives remain abstract—“frequency of hope,” “shared balance”—never embodied in a hard choice or visible cost; she is a catalyst, not a crucible. Townspeople follow in rhythmic lockstep without interior contradiction, so no relationship acts as crucible and no micro-choice exposes a hierarchy of values. The ending’s “earned stasis” is credited to the collective, but the agent herself exits unchanged and therefore unscored for personal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—thrall versus duty—rides every beat; the vial’s addictive tug is embodied in pulse and pocket warmth. Chen’s limp surrender and wheezing tank give credible counter-pressure, forcing her micro-choice to pocket the vial mid-rescue. Renunciation at the end is earned: same pocket that once seduced now seals the mystery, cost legible in her lingering gaze. Minor slip: Chen’s “lifetime studying” line drifts into expositional shorthand, not embodied memory.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Matthias’s motivation—inheritance of a “liar’s legacy” and the need to prove his father truthful—drives every step; the contradictory pull between shame and filial loyalty is kept alive in each micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete (“lattice grow warm in his hands”) rather than diagnostic. The final surrender to copper light is credible because every prior beat has been an audition for that transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—bead burning in palm, knees in soil—and his renunciation (“I release you”) is embodied, not abstract. Eleanora’s contradiction (love vs. immortality) is stated more than dramatized in present action; she observes, never chooses again. The generational bead as inherited flaw is specific, but the bloodline motive is told in a single expository lump. Still, the final act costs Marcus his heirloom and ancestral guilt, a visible forfeit that satisfies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The weaver’s motivation—transform ruin into reverence—remains legible and consistent; her nightly sleepwalking stitches are micro-choices that visibly cost her (missing fingers, dawn exhaustion). Interiority stays concrete and occupational: net-mending muscle memory transposes to silk bridges. The earned renunciation at the end (she walks away, work finished) carries felt cost: red dust under nails, dreams still wandering. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the quick test for 9+ is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is concrete—her feet “choose directions while her mind sifted,” a lovely embodied contradiction—but the moment she decides to stay is delivered as abstract summary (“She would stay, she decided”) rather than dramatized choice with visible cost. The grandmother’s absence keeps relationship-as-crucible off-stage; villagers function as warm chorus, never applying individual pressure that would force Miriam to test or betray her hierarchy of values. Micro-choices inside the tomb are evocative (pressing blossom like “offering”), yet the beat that actually forecloses exile-versus-return is elided, so the renunciation feels assumed, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Iris’s interior contradiction—clandestine name-maker now risking exposure with her own true name—grounds every beat; the trembling hand on the brass slot embodies the cost. The micro-choice to trust the children’s chalk code is specific and value-revealing. Yet the daughter remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is inferred not dramatized, capping the upper band. Still, the flaw that drives the mistake (her need for self-reconciliation) is the same one that exacts the price, satisfying earned-stasis logic.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirelle’s “wise-codger” persona is credibly double-edged: every cackle or tremor is a calculated performance that still costs her stamina and time. The embroidery-as-espionage conceit gives her three concrete micro-choices (decoding the flame, selecting stitches, choosing Tomas as courier) that escalate risk. Interiority stays specific—thread burn, arthritic knuckles—avoiding diagnostic self-talk. Cost is visible: she forfeits rest and safety, finishing the cloth while boots thunder toward her; the ending’s Earned Stasis (she can only pray the right eye reads it) feels proportionate to her limited agency.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Meera’s calm authority and the client’s trembling need are sharply embodied; the micro-choice to hand over the shard crystallizes Meera’s vocation. Interiority is concrete (“grief-hollowed face,” “fierce tenderness”) and avoids therapy-speak. The client’s final breath of release shows a credible, earned shift; the cost is the permanent absence of the sister, felt in the shard pressed to the chest. Voice distinction is irrelevant—only Meera speaks at length—but her cryptic register stays consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maricel’s translator-habit of staying conscious, her tactile grip on the coral, and the decision to act tomorrow all flow from one coherent interior logic; the smudged-cast decryption is the single visible micro-choice that tilts her stance and forecloses passive acceptance. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—her need to make luminous murals that feel genuine versus the hollowness she can’t fake—drives every micro-choice from unwrapping the fragment to painting the studio wall. Embodied emotion is vivid: the laugh that surprises her, the softening vision, the midnight wall “blazing.” The final renunciation (she will paint the district itself in light) is earned by the因果 chain of studying the fragment and costs her the safety of generic cheer. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; solo-portrait depth is strong enough for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—methodical restorer vs. dream-driven seeker—surfaces early and drives the final choice to keep the fresco exposed, paying the cost of professional risk. The “methodically playful” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (coin pocketing, gentle tap) rather than labels. Yet the twin/doppelgänger beat is delivered as static image, not an active test of identity, so the arc’s emotional crest feels under-complicated for 9+ terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias radiates rogue-scholar charisma and acts as the club’s charismatic pivot; his cryptic manner is shown, not just labeled, and the final “begin” beat crystallizes his leadership cost. Interiority stays externalized through playful diction and butterfly choreography; we see contradictions flare when he corrects “taught” to “joined.” Mara’s dirty hands and Linear-A notebook sketch credible complicity, but her interior stakes stay secondary. The earned cost is collective rather than individual: the club warps itself into untaxable shape under his call, a renunciation that forecloses legitimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The poet’s 300-year insomnia and her vow to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” are vivid, embodied motives; every beat of the poem-writing ritual is a micro-choice that costs her sleep and sanity. The final smile-and-begin-again is a credible renunciation that forecloses any ordinary human future, paying the visible price of perpetual solitude. Interior contradiction is present—wanting peace yet feeding on war’s grief—but stays slightly abstract; a single moment of bodily collapse or tremor would have pushed it to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Miren’s contradictory impulses—protocol vs. transformation—are dramatized in the moment she renounces repair; the cost of preserving the crack is felt in the foxglove-regret image. Interiority stays concrete, not therapeutic. The micro-choice to hang the broken chime in “a place of honor” crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible price. No label-speak; “foxglove regret” is embodied, not diagnosed.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her hand “dances between control and surrender,” her chest “aches” at Marcus’s graying temples. The contradictory impulses (fear of honesty vs. need to speak) are dramatized in the physically precarious act of writing with living ink. The final gesture of joined hands crystallizes a credible, costly shift: she hazards permanent separation to regain trust. Only the “misplaced loyalty” motive is told once, not re-embodied, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—precision versus compassion—is dramatized through the micro-choice to leave her report unsealed, paying the price of political exposure. The trembling hands while sketching the redesign embody the stakes; competence is balanced by visible emotional struggle. Grandfather’s remembered voice anchors her value hierarchy without slipping into epiphany-speak. Flaw: the “ingenious” label is asserted rather than demonstrated in prior beat-work, slightly thinning motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—urge to flee vs. need to stay—are alive in the dust-mote mapping and in her decision to place the meteorite on the sill; the final endurance costs her the safety of perpetual reinvention. Interiority is concrete, biased, and bird-handler specific (“tracking how they rose on warm currents”). Only minor slippage: the phrase “learning to become” edges toward therapeutic abstraction, not quite embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses (search vs. endure, blame vs. understand) play out in her fingertips on the rail and in the logbook micro-choice. The final stance—teaching thresholds instead of crossing them—arrives via the oak’s grain and her father’s mathematics, so the renunciation is earned and priced. Minor slip: “featherly determined” is used as label twice before it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Senna’s longing for “the rhythm of belonging” is stated early and re-iterated, but the interior contradiction between exile-as-home and scientific detachment is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choice until the final suit-diagnostics beat. The burnt-feather cue supplies a tactile obsession, yet her emotional reaction stays at a single register of wonder, never complicating under rising pressure. The closing decision to exit the dome is credible, but the cost (career, safety, identity) is named only as abstract “transformation,” not felt in body or future consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—her “cheerful gloom” is embodied in how she fingers the vials and how her breath catches at the vision of unmade lives. The final renunciation—accepting the mercy of forgetting—carries cost because the frantic transliteration shows her hunger to keep what must be lost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in real time, only realized after the vision, so the beat falls just short of full contradiction-in-scene required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s grief-derived compulsion to “order randomness” is concrete and embodied through chess moves and micro-staging; her interior contradiction (control vs. longing for surprise) is dramatized in the loss to Rebecca. The bishop token works as charged tactile memory, but the emotional cost of that loss is lightly sketched—her laugh is the only visible price. Relationship/status pressure only appears in the final beat; prior street-performer interactions feel like props rather than crucibles. Still, her perceptual filter (tide charts, callus reads) stays sharp and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaleth’s interiority is lyrical and embodied—her spine “curved like waves” and cells “writing into DNA” give visceral stakes to exile. Yet her contradictory impulses (remember vs. ban compliance) are asserted more than dramatized; no moment forces an explicit choice between safety and memory until the swallow, so the renunciation feels foregone rather than fought. The final stasis is earned—she is “spontaneously anchored not by gravity generators but by the weight of what she’d become”—but the cost is poetic, not tactical. Voice is distinct, obsession credible; still, a single micro-choice under threat would have nudged this into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Martin’s interior contradiction—thirty years of craft now felt “hollow”—is concrete and anchored early. The embodied emotion (scarred hands, pocketed stone) stays specific, and the micro-choice to throw the stone crystallizes his shift from repair to revelation. No second character means relationship/status bullets are N/A; the solo arc suffices at this length. Closure is credible renunciation: he pockets the remaining stones, foreclosing passive contemplation, cost felt in the即时 image of turning “toward town."

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s guilt-driven self-scar refusal, embodied burn echoes, and micro-choice to descend with the cracked box earn a credible renunciation; the “hard-soft” stance crystallizes. Interiority runs thick, but “bargained innocence” is asserted more than dramatized in scene, and daughter/marriage pressure is off-page, muting relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority stays anchored in tactile detail—shells, glass, the gauge’s needle—and her contradictory impulses (precision vs. wonder) dramatize each micro-choice. The final gesture of surrendering the gauge earns its cost because every prior beat has rehearsed the act of measuring as identity. No therapy-speak, no label-only emotion; even “hope” is reframed as a pattern she must physically weave. The only bar to 9.0 is that the grandmother’s last words arrive as quoted aphorism rather than embodied memory, slightly diluting the personal flaw that drives the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s loneliness and hypersensitive vocation feel lived-in; the moment she palms the wall and registers “ancient respiration” shows interior contradiction in action. The diary/film discovery externalizes internal stakes cleanly; her trembling hands dramatize embodied cost without label-speak. The closing micro-choice—“she would continue mapping”—is a credible renunciation that forecloses escape from the family curse. Missing only a secondary on-page relationship to act as crucible, but single-POV pressure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vesper’s calm-under-pressure trait is repeatedly dramatized (painting while bells threaten, doubled heartbeat steady), but the interior contradiction between her own life and the borrowed pulse is asserted more than enacted; no moment shows that twin tension forcing a micro-choice that costs her. The borrowed-heartbeat concept is vivid, yet its emotional price is summarized (“perceptively calm”) rather than felt in a beat of hesitation, lapse, or overreach. Because the final image reweights the city rather than her stance, the character arc feels observational, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s wearied, ritual-hardened interiority is vivid; her micro-choice to interrupt the general with “This is the method” crystallises her authority under pressure. The contradiction between diplomatic gentleness and steely coercion is dramatised, not told. However, no on-page flaw or blind-spot compounds to cost her personally—her gamble wins too smoothly—so the arc feels competent rather than crucible-scarred.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority—cynical water-baron who still pockets his dead father’s bird journals—carries credible contradiction; the sentimental tether is shown via tactile micro-choices (glove removal, egg weight, the release) rather than label-speak. The final renunciation is foreshadowed by pattern (bird-shaped cracks he himself authored) so the emotional cost feels earned. Minor gap: we get no embodied sense of how seven-figure loss hits him in real time; the micro-choice happens but the price is more poetic than corporeal, keeping it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Celestine’s interior arc—chaste courtesan who reclaims voice—lands cleanly; her bodily-poetic finesse and micro-choices (kneeling to untangle threads, arms wide under the singing shards) are dramatized with cost. Her contradictory hunger for both beauty’s cage and disruptive truth remains felt in the breath between sigh and smile. Only minor flaw: “living sculpture of restraint” flirts with label-speak; it is brief and does not undercut the earned laugh that ends her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured—his past as calligrapher vs puppet-provocateur sets up a lived contradiction—but the epiphany pivots on told summary (“understood what he needed to do”) rather than a micro-choice we watch. The reversal is declared, not dramatized, so cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the flaw-to-stance arc is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—“knot in her chest” and the imperative to “keep building” dramatize her motive under pressure. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. making) stay entwined in-scene, visible in micro-choices: selecting perishable hemp, placing the moth wing, accepting the tower’s collapse. No second character means no status crucible, but that default is waived. Closure—her benediction touch—costs her a foreclosed future of building, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s grief-forged need to “preserve what love had whispered” drives every micro-choice; the contradiction between her caster-precision and memory-failure is lived in finger-level braiding, not told. The final act of pouring rope into bronze bells crystallizes a credible renunciation—she gifts the voices to the wind, not to herself—paying the cost of perpetual exile from the memories she saves. Interiority remains concrete and tool-bound; only once drifts toward “she understood it was listening,” a quasi-epiphany that nicks the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s paradoxical gift is vividly interiorized—“she could see it in hindsight from tomorrow morning”—but she never makes a present-tense choice that costs her anything; the final “understanding” is epiphanic summary, not an embodied decision with stakes. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene; the archive simply confirms what she already suspected. The arc is observation, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frugal astronomer’s drive is palpable and embodied through patched trousers, borrowed gear, and her last-savings desert trek. Interiority stays concrete: her “spiritual kinship” surfaces while cross-referencing by lamplight, not in abstract self-analysis. The covenant motive tightens across beats—she photographs, sketches, and finally weeps—yet the shift from scholarly curiosity to filial emotion is slightly abrupt, blunting the cost scale. Still, her micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, digging with hands) keep her idiosyncratic and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s calm, patient manipulator persona is vivid and consistent; her refusal to meet rage with rage feels lived-in. Kale’s fury-to-release arc is embodied through cellular-memory visions rather than exposition, letting us feel the shift in her cells before she names it. The moment Kale’s fingertip re-grows the pin, the cost of letting go is made flesh, earning the change. Only the tiniest trace of therapeutic label-speak (“release his hatred”) keeps this from a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s grief-driven fixation is visceral, and the mirror-paste ritual gives her a tactile, high-stakes micro-choice. The brother’s translucent return shows cost on both sides, but his interiority is reported second-hand, so the emotional ledger feels slightly lopsided. Still, her anchored body-breath-fog sync and the final hand-clasp crystallize a believable, costly reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the corporate sell-out versus hunger for reconciliation—are dramatized in her tense climb and the micro-choice to unwrap the grandmother’s stone. The embodied tremor of her “chest tightening” and the final joined hands give credible emotional cost. Lena’s anger-to-willingness transition is sketched more briskly, blunting the relationship crucible, and the interior line “I thought progress meant…” flirts with diagnostic shorthand, preventing the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “curator’s hands,” the steam-silence epiphany, the warmth of the blank shell. The nonlinear inheritance concept lets her contradictory impulses (duty vs. terror vs. wonder) coexist in-scene. Her micro-choice to kneel and lift the blank shell crystallizes her acceptance of a future cost. The only minor lapse: the marriage-backstory feels tacked-on; it doesn’t alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marin’s interiority is sharp—her linguistic training surfaces in sensory, non-generic ways (“proto-linguistic fragments reality once spoke”). The single contradiction—coming to rescue yet ready to seed knowledge outside—drives the climax negotiation, but the cost (she leaves carrying blank pages now sprouting new language) is stated more than felt; a hairline slip keeps this just outside the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s grief-torn interiority is vivid—embodied trembling, salt-crusted porthole, trembling card—but her final “thread that hurt least” choice is declared, not dramatized; we feel the ache yet never see the specific memory she seizes or forfeits, so the cost is atmospheric rather than earned in a visible beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s “warmly methodical” temperament is shown through tactile micro-choices (cross-referencing notebook, quiet self-talk), but the interior contradiction promised by the premise—scholarly detachment vs. temporal vertigo—never sharpens into a palpable cost; she finishes calm, unchanged, no visible price paid. The braid-work is competent observation, not struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s desperation is palpable and embodied; his interiority stays concrete (“clutched his pack…pressed deeper”). The final endurance carries cost—lantern spent, stone now his burden—yet the internal contradiction between fear and duty could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Esme’s motive—coincidence as prayer—drives every move; the retrocognitive flashes are embodied (hand on shard, frost-flower mind-bloom) and alter her next action, not just mood. The renunciation of accident belief costs her solitude and safety, felt when she descends alone at dawn. Minor slip: “understood with sudden clarity” skirts diagnostic-speak but is saved by immediate physical consequence (charts spread, prism pieces lifted). Interiority stays character-specific; no stock beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elden’s interiority is vivid—her preemptive nostalgia is embodied in gesture and perception, not label—and her final surrender is foreshadowed by her earlier caress of the child-laughter crystal. The contradiction between her curatorial drive and the archive’s emergent self-awareness is dramatized in the looping shadow beat, giving her absorption a felt cost. Yet the predecessor’s vanishing is only asserted, so the choice to merge lacks a second human model to push against. Still, her flaw (nostalgia-as-identity) directly enables the recursive closure, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s muscle-memory choreography and the embodied ritual of chant–spin–walk give us a lived-in interiority; the burn-scarred woman’s first gesture (unwrapping the knot) immediately pressures him, so his choice to spin unlit is earned. The “smoke of hopelessness” is the only near-label, but it is quickly grounded in the festival accident flashback. The ending renunciation—spinning without fire yet feeling wonder—pays the cost of identity re-definition. Secondary characters remain functional archetypes rather than full individuals, limiting upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Chen’s “warmly observant” bent is dramatized in the way he reads Mira’s hem-twist and breathing shifts, then links them to tide data; the same trait blinds him to direct emotional confrontation, giving credible interior contradiction. Mira’s want—to be “needed more directly”—is legible and feeds the dominant stake. The final stance crystallizes when he kneels and offers the cicada, a micro-choice that re-weights their status: she accepts it and leans in, a visible cost to both. Only minor softness: “I approached everything tangentially” is delivered as retrospective diagnosis rather than embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—claustrophobia born in bunkers versus craving the open sky—drives every beat and the final renunciation. Her micro-choices (kicking off the vine, clutching the doll, choosing to stay) are consistent, embodied, and escalate under pressure. The mother remains off-page; no relationship crucible to test, so bullet waived. Cost is felt: she forfeits the subterranean safety her mother engineered, accepting perpetual exposure as the price of breathable space.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marco’s interiority is concrete and occupation-specific; his “fluidly logical” calm is shown through micro-choices—lowering the motor, selecting the prism-dense corridor—rather than labels. Elena’s contradictory impulses (clenched rail vs. eventual eyes-closed surrender) are embodied in gesture and silence, not therapy-speak. The final promise (“Always”) crystallizes an earned renunciation: he gives her the silence she needs, forfeiting his usual tourist patter. Minor deduction: once “possibility” is named aloud, slightly abstracting what the prism-song has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaida’s curiosity and historian’s hunger feel authentic; her pulse-quickening at the mural is concrete. Interiority stays specific to a lore-keeper’s training—scanner, frequencies, dead languages—rather than generic awe. The micro-choice to kneel and press palms to glass crystallizes her shift from observer to participant. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; backstory is tightly anchored to present cues.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation—to teach suffocating to breathe—lands as consistent, but the interiority drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“make suffocating breathe,” “love means accommodation”). Scars as linking method are declared, not dramatized; the girl’s arrival is passive, so the micro-choice of “taking her hand” feels pre-ordained rather than pressured. Earned stasis is credible, yet the absence of any visible flaw or mistake keeps the arc emotionally tidy. Interior contradiction is asserted, not enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s survivor-guilt and translated-virtue motive powers every beat; the "virtuously mischievous" tag is shown, not told, in her bolt-install gamble. Interiority is sensorily anchored ("fingers along the racks...quantum hum") and contradicts hope with residual shame. The final pocketing of diamond-and-bolt crystallises earned change with visible, portable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassian’s inherited guilt and crusade for full disclosure are vivid, but his interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“he began to muse on what this meant”) that no one mid-arc utters aloud. The micro-choice to crank the cylinder is perfectly motivated; the later resolve to confront the council is foreshadowed yet lacks an embodied beat of cost on the page. Still, contradictory impulses—loyalty to blood vs. need for expiation—stay active in scene, earning a strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Earns a credible internal arc—he moves from paralyzed withdrawal to chosen motion—but the “strings” revelation is told more than dramatized, muting the cost. Micro-choices (removing armor, murmuring a self-authored oath) are present yet compressed; we see only one beat of actual dancing, so the bodily stakes feel sketched. Interiority is lyric but abstract (“shivering bliss”), limiting contradictions-in-scene. Still, the knight’s flaw (refusal to finish the oath) directly shapes the climax, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is concrete—her finger in dust, the brass button pressing her palm—and her choice to cross-file Samuel/Isaiah is earned by the accumulation of loss she witnesses. The “broken-hearted archivist” trait is label-heavy early on, but her embodied cataloguing gestures and the final micro-choice (she “began a new file”) convert the label into action with visible cost: she accepts perpetual heart-tending. Secondary pressure is absent—no one else appears—so relationship crucible is N/A. Flaw is present (emotional self-exile) and complicates her stance; the ending’s Earned Stasis is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s “quiet, ordinary” camouflage is shown through tactile beats—hiding in a telecom vault, exposing ghost-streets with an obsolete camera—so her competence feels earned. The interior contradiction between fear and stubborn persistence is alive in micro-choices (developing photos while a searchlight grazes the shore). No second character on stage limits relationship-as-crucible, but her solitary endurance still incurs visible cost: the hatch clang seals her into darkness and a deeper vanishing. Motivation stays anchored to the refusal-to-forget; the ending’s Earned Stasis is proportionate to story length.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s memory-triggered tremor and the grandmother-haunted set-list micro-choice embody contradictory impulses in-scene; the renunciation of prophecy via deliberate anti-selody carries visible cost—his literal breath used to erase family doom—so the 9+ test is met, though secondary-pressure from an off-stage family never fully materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miren’s seed-sorter identity is established early and colors her noticing, but her transformation is reported (“there was something fluid”) rather than dramatized; the epiphany is delivered as summary, not embodied choice. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“obsession,” “mystery she pursued”) without contradictory impulses acted under pressure. The final stance—merging with the message—is earned, yet the cost is poetic assertion, not on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s “uncertain certainty” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—trusting spring tension, improvising vinegar rinse, deciding to leave the chamber open—each carrying a visible, incremental cost in time and identity. His interiority stays concrete (frozen gears, mossy tools) and avoids diagnostic labels; the final renunciation of “restoration” is earned because every beat has forced him to trade certainty for possibility. Flaws (hoarding, solitude) complicate rather than decorate; the spine of the story is his growing willingness to preserve fractures instead of fixing them. No second character appears, so relational bullets are waived; headcount stays clean and choreography uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “luminous regret” is re-evoked each time she touches the coin or bellows—so the embodied emotion holds. The single contradiction she carries (healer who weaponizes memory) is active in the decision to fuse, not merely declared. The final renunciation—handing over a mended absence, not the child—pays the cost visibly in the magistrate’s tears and her own return to the steaming foundry. Only the sister backstory drifts toward label-epiphany, but it is anchored to present micro-choice (walk back alone), so the flaw stays sub-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “found the harp,” the tooth “flare hot”—and her micro-choice to laugh at the frosting absurdity is a credible, character-specific response that alters the ghost’s stance. The flaw: “modestly fearless” is asserted once but never tested or complicated; she never hesitates, so the trait feels declarative rather than dramatized. Still, the laugh-cry contradiction and the earned fade-out give her a visible cost and a reconfiguration of identity as healer, not mere extractor.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sera’s interior contradiction—needing to quantify mercy while her body screams against the metric—plays out in every tactile beat; the final “teach me” is earned because her prior micro-choices (clipping the mask, planting) visibly foreclose retreat. The old man functions less as a second character than as a mirror, so status dynamics are thin, but her embodied trauma arithmetic is specific and unbalancing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s desire to “honor overlooked histories” is stated early and re-anchored in the grandmother memory, but her interior contradiction—yearning for the tangible while translating the immaterial—never sharpens into a single high-cost micro-choice. The lens fragment is handled, yet the beat where she “positions it over the first painting” is summarized, not dramatized, so the visible price (time, risk, emotional exposure) is only asserted. Closure earns a modest Charged Poise: she watches the next child, feeling “time compress,” but the cost is retrospective, not freshly paid on the page. Still, the occupation-specific perceptual bias (seeing “between languages”) colors every image, keeping her above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s elevator-ghost gift gives him a credible, job-honed perceptual lens; the promise to Celeste crystallizes a single, costly renunciation that forecloses his original mercenary intent. Interiority stays concrete (“weightless burden…prayer”) and avoids label-speak. The daughter memory is the only telegraphed emotion, but it is anchored in a present tactile cue (looking up) so the beat still earns its place. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets correctly skipped; micro-choice hierarchy visible when he pockets the barrel instead of the cash he came for.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—“I’ll keep everything safe, even if it means keeping everything the same” crystallizes her flaw and anchors the loop. Micro-choice—reaching for the biography as the orchard spins—embodies the rupture with visible cost. Operator remains more catalyst than crucible, softening the “relationship as crucible” test, but her earned awakening is fully motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kasimir’s interior contradiction—ex-revolutionary turned solitary archivist—drives every beat; his body registers time-light as “weight of obsolescence” and his fingers hover, never touching, enacting fragile restraint. The choice to reinterpret the shard rather than seize it crystallizes his shift from smash-and-rebuild to memorial poetics, foreclosing a return to activism with visible cost: his name remains “an embarrassment.” No second character on stage, so status/relationship bullets skipped; single-POV interiority stays specific, avoids diagnostic labels. Micro-choice of pen-on-paper versus mortar-into-wall anchors the hierarchy of values—grief over glory—earning the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aldric’s quiet competence and the micro-choice to trust the forget-me-not as lie-detector give him texture; the interior contradiction between mechanical perfection and moral rot is felt, but his final stance is more stated than performed—no visible cost on the page beyond closing the lid.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “hinged awakenings,” her synesthetic bottle-labels, her boots-versus-braid pragmatism all texture the page. The psychometry micro-choices (thumb on brass, water-touch) link past-Henrik to present-Mara and foreshadow her own immersion, so the final surrender feels earned. The only slack is the village’s “sensibly eccentric” label, stated not shown; still, her every subsequent action rewrites that cliché into embodied risk. Cost is legible: she forgoes the compass, the surface world, and any nameable future.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is convincingly tied to her sculptor’s eye—reading storm-ripped landscapes, feeling “turbine-hum reverie” in her body. Her discovery of the slide triggers a visible shift in creative method: from “scaffold complexity with simplicity” to layered transparency, a choice enacted when she pockets the slide and selects the cedar root-ball. The only drag is a faint self-explanatory gloss (“she realized something new…”) rather than pure embodied inference, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her stalled art, inherited postcards, and the cathedral conversation all feel particular. Yet the decisive shift (she “finally knew what to paint”) is declared, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that proves the cost of that knowledge. Father Benedict’s presence is functional but thin; his “quietly driven” trait never constrains an on-page action. The arc lands, but the emotional price is summarized, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Malik’s curator identity and twelve-year archive labor credibly anchor his leap to descend alone; the micro-choice to kneel and accept the lagoon’s visions shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“weight of every archive”) without therapy-speak. The shared-witness pact is earned because his entire vocation foreshadows it. Sarai’s flat diction (“Am I?”) and sudden full exposition slightly undercut her lived erosion, keeping this just below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miranda’s interior contradiction—her contempt for easy remedies vs. her hunger to resurrect—drives every beat; the refusal to open the bottle is a credible renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing her old alchemist identity. Emotion stays embodied (“bottle grew warmer in her palm… pulsing like a heart”). Micro-choices (nightly return to the bottle, showing it to newcomers) keep agency alive. No second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets skipped; head-count irrelevant. The earned stasis lands cleanly, though the shift from lone exile to community leader is slightly telescoped.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Madame Verity’s muteness and Marcus’s twenty-year language quest give credible interior contradiction; the hand-immersion beat crystallizes their bond with embodied cost. Yet the leap from child to archivist is summarized, not dramatized, so the adult Marcus’s motives feel inherited rather than freshly earned. Still, the oath ledger refusal at the end lands as Earned Stasis with visible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm against the acorn cap, the spiral of borrowed years scraping like burlap—yet the “furiously tranquil” label is used twice without dramatized contradiction, a hairline slip that keeps her from full contradictory-in-scene mastery. The renunciation of her grandmother’s unclaimed decades is earned and costly, visible in the shattering vortex that rewilds the seeds. No second character on the page, so relationship crucible is N/A; solo arc is compelling. Micro-choices (pressing cap to ice, stepping into spiral) consistently reveal her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s obsession with manual intuition over algorithms is shown through tactile rope beats and the decisive override switch; the internal contradiction between scientific training and folk sensing is never stated, only enacted. Her seven-year vigil is embodied in calloused hands and the rope’s worn fibers, not back-story labels. The final choice to keep ringing until the stone cracks visibly costs her physical safety and institutional standing, satisfying Earned Stasis. No secondary character on page; headcount waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s quiet renunciation of her former life is dramatized through the ritual of mop-and-log, not told; the contradiction between solitude and cosmic communion is held in scene. Interiority stays concrete (“permeable, present, powerful in her acceptance of smallness”) without therapeutic gloss. The final endurance—keep polishing until systems fail—carries visible cost: she forfeits return, fame, even witness. Only the empathizing-with-meteors beat drifts toward abstraction; a brief filter-verb stack (“She thought about…”) keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—she “reads dust patterns” and chooses speech over silence with visible cost. The flaw-consequence chain is present: her refusal to repeat the elders’ silence dissolves ghosts on the page. Yet the emotional turn hinges on a single diagnostic line—“what we don’t say becomes the ghost”—that momentarily abstracts the body. Still, the renunciation is earned and irreversible under the eucalyptus, so characterization clears the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s vocation and nightly mission are vividly particular, but her interior contradiction—guarding linear time while living in a world that has renounced it—stays declared rather than dramatized in scene; the moment she lifts the urn shard to the stars is the only beat where embodied emotion and micro-choice fuse under pressure, so the renunciation feels earned yet narrowly isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete—her noticing of the kite’s “desperate pull” and her memory of her mother’s sea-death feel earned. The boy’s grief is sketched lightly but credibly; his halting speech differentiates him. The final gift of the torn feather crystallizes her value hierarchy on the page. Minor: the phrase “precise moment when darkness surrendered to light” drifts toward abstraction, softening the contradiction that could have sharpened her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s “brazen calm” is shown through steady, embodied labor rather than abstract self-talk; the diary-guided micro-choices (wrapping copper, chiseling limestone) externalize her motivation and track a credible arc from caretaker to participatory architect of interspecies dialogue. Interior contradiction is light—she never doubts the task—so the arc is more steady revelation than wrenching change, but the cost is legible in her final exhaustion. The reflective blocks stay anchored to present tactile cues and alter her next move, satisfying BRR. A hair more contradiction or risk of failure would lift this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is sharp—her contradictory need to quantify nostalgia while surrendering to it is shown through her muddy boot-prints and the amber she palms like a rosary. The final micro-choice—accepting Quorum as walking companion—pays for her earlier clinical detachment with visible cost: footprints about to be erased by rain. Status shift with Quorum is subtle but legible: from interrogator to fellow pilgrim. Voice convergence at closure is acceptable because her internal cadence stays distinct.

    The coachman’s quiet, ritualized precision—speaking to birds in dead tongues, kneeling to work seeds into war-salted cracks—makes his interior life legible without exposition. His inherited gift and wartime memory create a lived-in contradiction that justifies the ending’s renunciation. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only cap: we never feel him risk failure; the task seems pre-ordained, so the cost is contemplative rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mercy the bloodhound is vivid—her graying ears, her sleeping under the bench, her sudden re-activation by scent—but Calder remains slightly generic: we get his occupation and one preserved leaf, yet no contradictory interior pulse or visible flaw under pressure. His final pivot from resignation to cartographer-of-hope is rapid but grounded in the cylinder’s concrete instructions, so the change is credible if not deeply textured. The pair’s shared history (her corpse-tracking, his voice-excavating) is economically sketched and motivates the closure beat. Interiority stays modest and occupational; no diagnostic self-help speak, but also no moment where Calder’s body betrays him or his thought contradicts itself under stress, so the crucible never quite chars him.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and sensorily anchored; her contradictory impulses—yearning for human connection yet choosing isolation—are dramatized through the micro-choice to stay at the compass rose each anniversary. The cost of her adaptation is viscerally felt: she can never leave without dying, a price that charges the final image. Voice remains distinct, though a few abstractions (“blessed pariah”) flirt with label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s shift from hoarder to sharer of secrets is legible and embodied in the tactile chess-piece ritual; his trembling fingers and cautious-abandon stance show cost. Interiority stays concrete—he “pets a wolf” when approaching the guardian—yet the epiphany “now I know secrets are meant to flow like water” drifts into label-speak, blunting the peak beat. The flaw complicates but does not unearn the arc, because the final image of descent “with open arms” still forecloses the old path. Relationship crucible is absent (single on-page character), so the score rests on solo interior credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s survivor guilt and need to inscribe the “small gestures” into permanence drive every beat; her refusal to sentimentalize yet insist on tenderness is credibly paradoxical. The embodied detail—“her scripted screams becoming genuine”—anchors the crisis-actor irony inside her body. Interiority stays concrete: she “walks letters only she could read from above,” a perceptual signature that fuses observer and scribe. No stock labels; even the final alliance with the archivist feels like a micro-choice that costs her sole authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—“shape of home” refracted through mercury-glass skin—and the final micro-choice to embed the stone burns with embodied cost. Yet the arc is almost entirely reflective; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the turn feels fore-ordained rather than wrestled. Still, the earned stasis lands cleanly and the reflective form justifies the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Petrov’s chess-teacher reflexes—tracing invisible boards, counting warps/wefts—are vivid, embodied, and motivate every beat. Guilt over the duchess threads cleanly into the present decoding task, giving interior contradiction a tactile outlet. The final renunciation (labyrinth left unseen) costs the explorer’s need for proof, earned by the prior craft-mistake parallel. Micro-choices (finger on green/gold border) reveal hierarchy of values without overt label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus the need to aestheticize guilt—are dramatized in each echo-game; the final “I forge through you” crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the clean absolution the ritual promised. Interiority stays concrete via ink-stained fingers and the tactile bone spire. Micro-choices (whispering verses, teaching others to refract) visibly advance her stance. Flaw: elder’s pushback is talked about more than felt; relationship crucible remains under-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s desperation and generational memory feel lived-in; the charm-as-key and lung-burning clock give embodied stakes. Interiority stays specific to her training—she tests resonance, counts pockmarks, budgets breath—never drifting into editorial gloss. The final choice to map scars instead of cure the sea is a credible renunciation that costs her the fairy-tale ending she (and we) hoped for.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren’s “intimately aloof” trait is embodied in her habitual refusal to learn names or accept coffee invitations; the cracked mirror and the cave work as externalizations of her internal fracture and thaw. The decision to paint on shells instead of canvas is a tangible micro-choice that enacts the promise she made at twenty-three, with visible cost (abandoned easel, fingers cramping). The only drag is a touch of therapy-speak: “something loosened inside her” floats above concrete sensation; still, the embodied arc from detached observer to present maker lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s vocation-driven motive is crisp; her “screaming tenderness” test fuels every beat. Interiority stays concrete (“pressed her forehead against the cool glass”) and her micro-choice to shorten the pulse interval crystallizes values under pressure. The Cost Proof Test is met: Thomas’s slow nod is a social price—public admission that louder failed. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the 9+ gate fails by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—grief’s pull vs. the need to map a way out—remains concrete in every micro-choice (tracing stitched coastlines, wiring cores, lifting the bronze). The final renunciation (“I navigate what remains”) is earned by the iterative building beats and carries visible cost: she stays alone under a broken dome while the world walks inward. Voice never slips into diagnostic abstraction; emotion stays lodged in calloused fingers and the jacket’s atlas. Only the brother/mother flashbacks feel slightly shorthand, keeping her from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rational, isolate forager Mira is credibly sketched through wary sensory detail and her cataloguing of mycelial data. Her shift from pure avoidance to guarded facilitation is embodied in her decision to host the orchard gatherings and hand over the relic; the cost is the erosion of her own defensive solitude, felt when she charges nothing and keeps no distance. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and her flaws (emotional stinginess, risk-aversion) actively complicate the choice to become caretaker. The reconciliation of Henrik and daughter occurs off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is secondary, capping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Magnus’s interiority is rich—his habit of “noticing absence” defines every beat, and the Edelweiss pin is a credible micro-choice that externalizes his calling. The memory-of-memory device lets his past feed present stakes without summary overload, and his decision to pin the flower on himself crystallizes earned cost. Flaw: we never feel him contradict himself in-scene; the arc is linear rather than crucible-hot. Still, the final stance carries palpable forfeiture of anonymity, enough to satisfy 8.8- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Martin’s loneliness is shown through lived detail—thirty years among crumbling maps, unanswered nephew-letters—rather than labels; the matrix-chip choice is credibly motivated by remembered grandmother cue. Interiority stays concrete: “empirically certain” feels map-dealer specific, not therapy-speak. The final micro-choice (“Seeking partner…”) is small but earned; cost is the visibility of risk after decades of retreat. Still, no second character on-page limits relationship crucible; flaw (passivity) is named but not dramatized in a beat that forces error.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The queen’s interior contradiction—scorning prophecy yet obeying her dreams—drives every step; her micro-choice to touch the bleeding starlight embodies both compulsion and self-interrogation. The final refusal to command the grotto, instead accepting witness, crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost: she descends “carrying the bleeding starlight inside her like a wound.” Secondary pressure is absent, so the 9+ gate is missed, but within single-POV the arc is complete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Solène’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. lover of presence—drives every micro-choice; the nautilus-touch, sphere-dripping, and final gifting are embodied, not labeled. Mira functions as pressure, not prop, forcing the confession that revalues the whole venture. The cost is felt when Solène admits she must “return differently,” foreclosing the safe Academy path. No stock phrases; every emotional beat is filtered through tactile detail (shell, twilight, warm sphere).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interiority is precise—her “chronologically confused” self-diagnosis feels lived, not clinical, and the scroll-keeping ritual dramatizes her coping. The jealousy toward past selves is a sharp contradictory impulse that recurs rather than alternates, and the final act of sealing the scroll is a credible renunciation with cost. Flaws (forgetting, envy, exhaustion) actively complicate every beat. No safety-hedging; her moral ambiguity stays messy.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—restoring broken things while denying her own need for repair—is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to keep the clock broken a little longer crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The screw-as-talisman reprise supplies felt cost: she trades immediate professional success for symbolic permission. Minor slip: “ordinary miracle” drifts toward label-speak in the penultimate paragraph, softening peak interiority. Still, motivation remains character-bound and the renunciation lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Margot’s contrition is embodied (gloved hand trembling on the perfume bottle) and her micro-choice to delete the article in real time gives the apology teeth; the because/therefore chain from cruel columnist → ghost-haunted → orchard exorcist is tight. Interior contradiction is alive when she admits she “meant it in her bones, not just her practiced voice.” Vivienne’s absence on-page keeps relationship crucible off the table, but the paper-vortex poltergeist supplies credible externalized pressure. Final endurance—choosing to carry the corrected story outward—costs her social rebirth, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—“time fold around her like origami”—and her walking-unify choice anchors the arc, but the “end of history witness” role is asserted, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse tests her training. The dictionary, spiral, and Hiccup act on her more than she acts on them, so agency feels ornamental rather than costly. The final stasis is beautiful but not earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—obedient technician vs. boundary-breaker—surfaces in the tactile decision to turn the key backward; the blood on the brass is a visible cost. Her competence and flaw (over-curiosity) are shown through micro-choices, not labels. The final Earned Stasis—she will keep pretending the world’s edge is fixed—carries credible psychological price. Only the absence of a second character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics from testing her further.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the compulsion to map every human moment as a breach is dramatized through bodily insomnia and the hour she keeps. The laser-pointer button becomes a tactile micro-choice that externalizes her contradiction—clutching vs. releasing—so the final “delete his number” feels earned rather than therapeutic declaration. Chen is sketched only as catalytic stranger, but since relationship crucible isn’t required for single-POV, the absence of his interiority is acceptable. What keeps this from 8+ is that the self-forgiveness beat is slightly abstract; we see the decision but not the immediate visceral cost (no tremor, no aftershock of emptiness) so the Earned Stasis is present yet under-embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—mathematical certainty vs. craving meaning in graffiti—are dramatized in the notebook/condensation beats. The hospital-bracket prop keeps her father present without flashback. The final micro-choice (leaving for the hospital) is small but earned: lantern-glimpsed “WIDEN YOUR VIEW” converts intellectual slogan into embodied next step. Cost is modest—no new risk is specified—so the arc tops out at mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sarah’s interior contradiction—protocol vs. compassion—drives every beat; the moment she wets her finger on the pipe condensation to play the disc, embodied cost is visible. The caller’s grief is filtered through distinct diction (“the universe made a mistake”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her final micro-choice—answering “Wrong number” as invitation—earns its poise because we’ve seen her earlier breakage punished by memory. Only the supervisor’s absence keeps the relational crucible from full pressure, a minor scope concession.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s archivist identity is embodied through the stained hands and magnifying-glass beat, but the climax choice—accepting the returnees—relies on a sudden collective epiphany rather than a prior micro-choice that costs her anything. Interiority is vivid (“strange arrhythmic dance”) yet the decisive beat is communal, diffusing personal agency. Still, her perceptual signature remains consistent and the endurance of seven solitary years is credibly felt. Flaws complicate rather than disappear; the cost is the solitude she can now relinquish.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s loneliness is embodied in her one-way conversation with a rock and the reflexive “desperately jocular bark” she admits is a mask; the arrival of Emil and the others forces micro-shifts from isolation to wary connection that accumulate into the final choice to “stay found.” Interior contradiction is vivid—“laughed—that desperately jocular bark she’d perfected to deflect genuine emotion”—and the stance tilt is dramatized when she lifts the stone in the dim light, recognizing the fragments as “permission.” The network-of-care payoff is earned because her prior competence and solitary reflexes are visibly costed by the pattern of vanishing before gratitude can attach. Only the secondary cast stays slightly schematic, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sera’s interiority is sensorially rich and embodied, but her contradictory impulses (grief vs. cartographic mastery) are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; the final renunciation is earned yet arrives in a single reflective paragraph, softening cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete (“confidently uncertain,” thumb rubbing the pen-nib) and her micro-choices (straightening the nib, filling it with ink) visibly mark her pivot from observer to co-author. The endurance/reconfiguration is earned: she accepts living “in the margin between drafts” and pays the cost of forever unstable memory. Minor over-labeling (“true work,” “edited universe”) nudges her slightly toward thesis-speak, not full embodiment, keeping her just under the 8.5+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—yearning to be remembered yet certain she’ll be forgotten—are dramatized in the moment she lifts the empty camera; the embodied tear-track and the final click-without-capture show cost. Theo’s quietly charismatic trait is more label than pressure, so relationship crucible remains partial. Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the “peculiar sensation of joyful sorrow” is lived, not diagnosed. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: the camera click ranks above permanence, endorsing presence over memory with felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory drives—scholarly rigor vs. outlaw urgency—are alive in every beat: she photographs while crying, maps while risking arrest. The “ghost-pressure” on her wrist from Kenji’s grandmother embodies motive better than any label, and her final vow to “keep your promise” crystallizes a renunciation that costs her everything. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and each theft is a visible micro-choice that tightens the ethical vise. Only the off-stage six-month gap keeps this from a 9: we are told, not shown, the moment she commits to burning her life down.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theo’s drumming micro-choices embody the quiet rebellion and memory bleed; the final hand-clasp shows earned fusion with felt cost. Marquez’s switch from scientist-guide to co-merger is credible but thin—her interior access is filtered through Theo, muting full contradiction. Interiority avoids label-speak, using percussion rhythm as embodied thought. Entanglement flaw—causal drive for separate identities versus merger—stays character-bound, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—he “traces his finger along the maintenance map,” “pocketed his folded map,” and “could hear three distinct gaits”—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values (listening > shouting). The final renunciation of “shouting his presence” is earned by the prior pattern of auditory attention; cost is felt when he realizes the labyrinth was “never about finding the way out.” Minor slip: the woman’s dialogue ventriloquizes the thesis (“You proved it…”) which momentarily flattens the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s motivation—protect the poor while safeguarding her siblings’ only income—is clear and personal; the mirror and grandmother legacy anchor her interiority. The guardian’s ‘spiralingly calm’ trait is shown through precise, wordless craftsmanship, not label. Both characters endure visible cost: Marina risks exposure, the guardian spends an hour of covert labor. Interior contradiction (guild loyalty vs moral duty) is active in-scene, though the sibling stake is named, not dramatized. No genuine flaw complicates her tactics; she never hesitates or mis-steps, muting struggle and keeping the score just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Miss Chen’s interiority is textured through chess-as-metaphor and a perceptual signature that notices silence; Danny’s disappointment lands in embodied gestures rather than labels. Their power dynamic—mentor steering a minor toward dissent—carries credible stakes, and her renunciation of his continued attendance (she demands free thought, not membership) crystallizes her values at cost. Yet Danny’s arc is largely reactive; his final decision to confront his father is off-page, muting the felt cost that would push this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s balletic dockwork and Kael’s pirate-longing are sharply embodied; their joined-hand decision carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“phantom weight of obligations” rather than labels—and the final choice is credibly earned. Minor over-articulation of “brutal tenderness” twice edges toward label-speak, but contradictory impulses remain live in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s compulsive narration is embodied and specific; the micro-choice to abandon it at the end crystallizes a credible shift. Emma’s mask-crack is minimal but motivated by the shared memory of the funeral flowers, so the change carries cost. Interior contradiction is present—he performs compliance while craving authentic grief—but the daughter’s arc is thinner, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Meris’s interiority is concrete (“the weight of silence,” “tremor of certainty”) and her micro-choice to compose inside the quartz anchors a credible renunciation. Kael’s pressure is minimal, so relationship-as-crucible is not required. Earned stasis lands with visible cost: she strides through boundaries “without looking back,” foreclosing retreat. Missing a second contradictory impulse in-scene caps the score just below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s color-blind painter identity drives every strategic choice—she trades awakenings for flawed objects—so her flaw is active, not ornamental. The interiority stays concrete: she “reads the world through texture,” never labels herself. The bargain with Tomás forces a visible cost: she permanently keeps his broken reed, a pocket-sized reminder that imperfection is currency. What keeps this from the top band is that Tomás himself is sketched more as grateful recipient than pressure source; his stake in the transaction feels auxiliary, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s crystalline spine, her quiet refusal to argue, and the moment she invites the stranger into the sound-bath all embody a powerfully gentle interiority. The micro-choice to repurpose her hated bells into an attractor shows contradictory impulses (shame/tool) acted in scene. The ending stance—sharing rather than studying—pays off her earlier isolation with felt cost (she surrenders sole authorship of the sound). Secondary pressure from the unnamed volunteer is thin, but within single-POV default the arc is credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s grief is embodied through tactile craft and micro-choices (climbing stairs, folding cranes, writing coordinates). The contradiction between authentic grief and “staged memorial” is held in scene, not stated. Senna’s arc is credibly paced: trembling hands → steady work → finished brooch that windows her mother. Final “quiet return to possibility” is earned by prior因果链 of shared labor and star-watching.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vesper’s “steadily curious” trait is shown through her measuring-tape comparisons and midnight labor, but the interior contradiction/flaw axis is thin; she never risks error or moral ambiguity, so the final partnership feels like convergence rather than costly renunciation. Marcus’s haunted look is evocative yet stays exterior; his single confide does pivot the stakes, but we get no interior push-pull about betraying family secrecy or fearing academic ridicule—motivation stays functional, not wrenching. Because neither character is forced to pay an on-page price (money, reputation, beloved deck), the ending’s collaboration lands more as neat resolution than earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The historian’s contradictory hunger for purity and grief for the small perfect things she must forfeit is dramatized in every crystal she absorbs; the final refusal to don the veil again crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost—“she would help her people avoid” that future. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the micro-choice to absorb the next crystal while weeping/laughing embodies the anguished-joy tone. The lone flaw: no second character on the page, so relationship/status crucible is absent, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sera’s interior contradiction—clinging to a private dream while curating a public archive—remains abstract; the river stone warms but never forces a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. Her decision to copy old files is declared, not dramatized, so the renunciation feels frictionless. The “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” label is repeated but never tested by an observable error or sacrifice. Earned stasis is asserted (“she would begin sharing”) rather than embodied in a beat where we feel the path close.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—genuine observation vs fabricated data—remains active throughout; her micro-choice to strip away the false numbers and re-submit raw field notes costs her the last hope of immediate academic redemption and is embodied in the shiver of the lantern light on the page. The chameleon-as-mirror is understated but effective; her spoken line “Honestly this time” crystallizes a credibly flawed self-forgiveness rather than a tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s need to reopen her wrist and read her scars is visceral and character-specific; the interiority is concrete, not therapeutic. The contradiction between seeking closure and literally reopening wounds is embodied in on-page micro-choices (pressing the hourglass to her bleeding wrist). The final turn—choosing justice over closure—earns its cost through the table’s memory and the roses’ testimony. Minor gap: we are told, not shown, the moment she decides to act on the revelation about Dr. Venn; causality is otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celeste’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her fingertips on the rail, the tingle of psychometric signature—while her contradictory impulses (hunger to mend vs. recognition that moments are gone) play out in the final gesture of dispersing the strips. The renunciation is earned: she pays the quiet cost of accepting love cannot be returned to source. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; micro-choices (opening the rusted box, projecting the map) reveal value hierarchy cleanly. Voice remains particular, never drifts into diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Celestine’s interiority is lyrical and specific—“dreams that whispered coordinates in languages she shouldn't understand”—but her contradictory impulses stay mostly summarized; the decisive turn (deliberately skewing the astrolabe) is visible and earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, softening the renunciation’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is lyrically specific—”the smoke clouds learned to hold their shape”—and her stoic, dreamless vigil is credibly exhausted. The renunciation of dreaming is Earned Stasis with cost: she forfeits private self for public nurture. No contradictory micro-choices are dramatized on-page, so the arc leans accumulative rather than causal; still, her final whisper-gesture lands as credible endurance. Secondary figure exists only as echo, so relationship crucible is waived without penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is rich and philosophically textured, but the protagonist’s choices are largely observational; the decisive gear-placement is guided by “intuition” rather than a visible, prior-won insight, so the final act feels slightly Gifted rather than earned. The sleep-translocation trait is named but never complicates his waking tactics—its cost is off-stage—so the flaw-cap keeps this just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the contradictory impulses (cling vs. run) are dramatized in the leash-snapped moment and re-lived in confession. The guides function less as characters than as lyrical chorus; their muted status keeps the crucible squarely on Mara, but their cryptic serenity risks near-magical convenience. The final renunciation—running without leash—is causally seeded by the ticket-punch visions and her own admission of “lighter,” so the cost is legible. Flaw: reliance on symbolic guides whose motives stay oceanic and off-stage; they nudge but never resist, so secondary-pressure value is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rielle’s interior contradiction—longing to learn the real cost vs. dread of discovering it—stays alive in every micro-choice (trudging upstairs, letting Silent-Choir guide her, touching the broken bolt). Her left-hand numbness and slowly returning pins-and-needles embody guilt/relief in the same gesture; the bench-wobble under her weight literalizes shared damage. Silent-Choir’s vow of silence is motive and obstacle: he can testify only via gesture and music; when he presses middle C then completes the chord, that single escalation changes Rielle’s goal from interrogation to duet. The final renunciation—playing on, accepting perpetual winter and partial reparation—earns its cost because the reader has felt her fingers ache back to life.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ossian’s quiet, centuries-deep vigil is conveyed through poised micro-choices—dissolving the pellet, selecting the lightning-quill, planting each rune—each step tightening his understated resolve. The“regally unpretentious”trait is lived, never declared: he works without spectacle, lets starlight evaporate“into constellations,”accepts endless duty. Interiority stays concrete(“the fabric of deception begin to sunder”)and the final small smile shows earned, proportionate cost. No contradictory impulses in scene, so the quick test isn’t fully met, capping the 9-band; still, character feels singular and immortal.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s grief-tinged vigilance is vivid—her drumming tic embodies inherited obsession—but the interior contradiction between scientific detachment and sudden code epiphany is asserted rather than dramatized; the final “listening” stance costs her nothing we see and feels like thematic punctuation, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kess’s barefoot vulnerability and opera-glass gaze give her a sharp perceptual signature; the internal contradiction between rebellious past and philosophical stillness is present but remains more asserted than embodied. The final renunciation inside the stone circle is credible because the hum is felt in her bones, yet the epiphany is slightly over-articulated (“they’d forgotten how to see”). No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall: strong, but the interior monologue flirts with diagnostic label-speak in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Naja’s insurgent past and secret plant-telepathy are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the final acceptance of golden spores crystallizes a lifetime of refusal. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the contradiction between hiding her gift and needing to share it tightens the beat. Cost is felt: she forfeits anonymity and steps into unknown mentorship. Only the thirty-year insurgency is asserted, not dramatized, keeping her just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her knees lock, hands freeze, throat tightens—showing contradictory impulses (grief vs. caretaking) in scene. The pearl-of-stillness practice is dramatized through micro-choices: she stops mid-prune, waits, breathes, then resumes, proving renunciation costs time and exposure to memory. The photograph’s pocketed presence and final release mark a visible, scaled cost: she lets go of the last intact relic. Only the “planned to work in refugee advocacy” line leans label-like, slightly blunting the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific (“luminescent ache,” “genuine struggle”); micro-choices track under pressure. Motivation drifts: initial “world no longer wanted her work” is strong, but later shift to “fragmentation was the human condition” feels imported rather than earned in-scene. Final renunciation lacks a visible cost—she simply “would paint differently,” no tangible forfeiture—so the change reads conceptual, not crucible-tested. Still, embodied emotion and perceptual signature keep her from slipping to mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s “serene anger” is embodied in micro-choices—halting the drone, letting ink patterns finish before cuffing Vera—so the trait drives visible trade-offs. The interior contradiction between justice and curiosity is dramatized, not labeled, and the final endurance (taking her in while still seeing the patterns) costs him the clean moral exit he could have claimed. Flaw: we never learn why the albino condition matters beyond sun glare; a single sentence of practical constraint would push this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—archival duty vs. truth-telling—are dramatized in the frost on her visor and the trembling hand that overrides safeties. The micro-choice to thaw only Dr. Chen crystallizes her hierarchy of values and is credibly foreshadowed by seven years of lonely cataloging. Felt cost is visible: she records her own death sentence in the log. Interiority stays concrete and avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—gentleness toward roses vs. quiet defiance of her father—are alive in scene, not summary. The moment she offers Kael the cutting while refusing to abandon the farm crystallizes her hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Kael’s micro-choice to sheath the blade is credible because the script has shown him touch it twice before under stress. Only the father’s interior remains slightly generic; the daughter’s arc is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s cool-headed resolve stays consistent, yet the story never lets us inside her skin long enough to feel the contradictory terror that should accompany fishing for a goddess; interiority remains atmospheric rather than embodied. Her only visible micro-choice—driving the spike, casting silence—reads as competent ritual, not desperate wager, so the earned cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. The grandmother echo supplies motive but not active pressure; the echo’s gift lands as grace, not staked gamble. Still, the characterization supports the lyric mode and the final Charged Poise holds under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celeste’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on brass, the nib scratching, the whispered “clever old ghost”—and her renunciation of silence carries visible cost. The flaw is that the emotional peak is filtered through a self-diagnosing tag (“the question orbited her still”) instead of a fresh bodily cue, docking 0.3. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: inherited empire vs. moral orbit, with the pen and observatory as instruments of that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied in the moth-wing lab and amber burn; her algorithmic detachment fractures under firmware’s sorrow. The causal chain from ignored nephew-cry → haunted code → self-translation is lucid, and her hand-to-amber micro-choice at the pipe-organ climax visibly prices the redemption. No stock therapy-speak; thought degrades into synesthetic overload. Secondary characters stay off-page, so no status or relationship deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Moth’s erased identity and intensified empathy supply a sharp, embodied contradiction; her chalking is never abstract but a tactile groping for self. The old man’s fleeting recognition and her immediate “Don’t speak it” crystallize a micro-choice hierarchy under pressure. Cost is felt: every stroke consumes the last chalk and the last chance to anchor others. The renunciation of speech for mandala-feeling is a credible, scaled foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Layla’s interiority is vivid—steel hands cooling after memory-extraction, the choice to read forbidden names aloud—but the “gentle radicalism” is asserted more than dramatized; we are told she “weaponizes empathy” rather than shown a micro-choice that risks new pain. The retrocognitive trap supplies constant pressure, yet the moment she breaks free feels slightly under-cooked: no bodily cost beyond shaking, no external consequence registered in the present plaza. Still, her contradiction—former burner turned archivist—remains legible and emotionally specific, earning a solid high-band foothold.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Margaux’s yearning for an encore is palpable and embodied; every pirouette through the orchard is a micro-choice that costs spectral stamina. The synesthetic trait is not label-only—color-bleeding footfalls make her phantom fatigue visible. Final bow accepts non-being, paying the ultimate price: self-scattering into garden-light. Interior contradiction (despair vs. performative hunger) stays live in scene, driving the dance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—fractal hand-tracing, pendant-touching—but “static-shock-as-origin” feels convenient, not earned; Chen is warmly sketched yet remains a sounding board. The final “Tonight, I map…” is a credible renunciation of certainty, but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Still, embodied tics and contradictory hope/doubt lift her above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—hunger for connection vs. duty to map—stays embodied in the elm-leaf squeeze and trembling fingers. The micro-choice to press fossil to wall crystallizes values and costs: she surrenders isolated watcher status, accepting irreversible porousness to alien emotion. Exterior behavior (furious mapping) diverges from interior need (to be witnessed), giving authentic tension. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority remains specific, avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s quietly inspired trait remains ornamental; the internal pivot from passive cataloguer to prophecy-spinner is told rather than dramatized with micro-choices. The moment she “began to study the buttons with new urgency” summarizes the shift instead of embodying it. Earned cost exists—she risks the warehouse becoming “just another tomb”—but the contradiction between duty and rebellion is asserted, not staged. Still, her embodied loneliness and the final, visible act of placing the jar and charts for strangers give her credible, flawed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s scarred hands and pillbox-fidgeting give us embodied, character-specific emotion; the contradiction between paralysis and the need to act is kept alive in every beat. The micro-choice to descend and recruit Emma crystallizes his shift from self-erasure to agency, paying the cost of exposure. Interiority avoids label-speak, relying on sensory cues like “silver hush.” The only minus: Sarah, though dead, is treated as an off-stage moral compass rather than a second pressure point, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Coachman’s ambient-listening trait is concrete and consistent; his final “all of it is true” renunciation costs him his customary silence and hands the woman a lived philosophy, visible on-page. Woman’s micro-choices—finger on clasp, leaning to window, opening case—embody her urgency without label-speak. Interior contradiction (comfort in fog vs. need to guide) stays subtextual, not declared. Relationship pressure is one-sided (he listens, she confesses) but alters her stance; his cost is the break in his own rule of not speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is sensorily anchored (“thrumbed in her bones”) and the lantern glass choice is embodied; the final renunciation of hardening is foreshadowed by her wheel-life. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—she wraps the glass before walking back. Still, the beekeeper’s flicker-existence lets her off a full interpersonal crucible; cost is more conceptual than interpersonal, capping at high-strong.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—she “sweeps” papery petals, “measures” the gauge tooth, “adjusts” mirrors—each micro-choice reveals her father-haunted need to unlock light for others. The flaw is safety-hedging: she never risks failure or real opposition, so her growth is only incremental recognition rather than costly renunciation. Still, the embodied metaphor of locksmith-turned-gardener keeps her singular and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's interiority is vivid—her thylacine memory is embodied in the concrete pacing ache, not told. Contradictory impulses (human intellect vs predator-instinct) coexist in the same beats, giving her credible hybrid agency. The final stance—choosing to keep translating—costs her the comfort of singularity; this renunciation is foreshadowed by the sundial’s uselessness, so the change feels earned. Voice stays specific to her perceptual filter; no diagnostic self-labeling undercuts the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Margot’s interiority is specific and embodied; the “wet hair plastered to her neck” anchors her physically while the letter she carries externalizes her secret vocation. Her decision to add her own letter to the spiral is a credible, earned renunciation that costs her the safe distance of ghostwriting. The contradiction between translating others’ longing and feeling hollow is dramatized, not stated. Only micro-slip: “fear of being nothing more than a conduit” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak for one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is visceral and embodied—“fillings ache,” charts move under her palm—so her competence and dread feel lived-in. The contradiction between her overnight-DJ shrug and cosmic-messenger burden is present but stated more than dramatized; we’re told she’s “cautiously hopeful” rather than shown micro-choices that risk that hope. Her decision to embed a mathematical signature in the subsonic track is a clear, stakes-laden choice that forecloses passive observation, earning the ending’s spiral reversal. Still, the story keeps her at arm’s length from any second character, so status/relationship pressure is absent and the cost, while conceptual, is not interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is embodied early and repeatedly tested under stone; her decision to kneel and trace the disc despite tightening chest shows contradictory impulses in scene. The compass point functions as an active talisman handled in at least three beats, linking grandfather, blueprint memory, and final rotation. Her prudence surfaces in the months of study and the camera she wields, yet the story lets risk win, earning the shift from fear to resolve. Interiority stays concrete and avoids label-speak; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost—she emerges with no physical key, only knowledge that will expose her to future danger.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s face-blindness and artistic method are dramatized through embodied action (charcoal choices, tactile paper-clips) and a single, costly renunciation: she surrenders the ribbon fragment to the portrait, sealing her inability to ever “see” Catherine yet giving Catherine back to others. The internal contradiction—painting what she cannot recognize—drives every beat; the final silence with Morrison carries felt cost. Secondary pressure is off-page (witnesses, detective), but Elena’s micro-choices remain the causal engine. Flaw: “diagnostic label-speak” moment (“she understood dormancy”) is brief and immediately paid with embodied cold, so stays within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—scholarly caution vs. ancestral devotion—surfaces in every beat; the copper nail is handled, pocketed, brandished, its coffin origin kept alive in tactile memory. Micro-choices (spreading journals, suiting up, inviting Kao) flow from the same motive string and escalate to the final air-lock step. The only dent: “spongey dread” is named but not embodied in pulse, breath, or skin—the body stays curiously calm under existential threat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s vocation and habit of noticing are cleanly dramatized in the opening beats; the violin is both tool and lens, never just label. Interiority stays concrete (“luminous disbelief coursed through her veins”) and ties directly to sensory triggers (glass flake warmth, wrap flutter). The final endurance of playing until sunset shows embodied cost, but the decision to stay and play is slightly under-motivated—no prior beat plants that she would risk bodily exhaustion for strangers between resolutions. Still, the micro-choice to translate flutter-code into music is idiosyncratic and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marco’s “polished calm” is shown through sensory micro-choices (brewing coffee, cataloguing forest change) rather than label-speak; the same trait constrains his offer to his father and costs him the safety of isolation. Interior contradiction is present—he both shelters and risks exposure—yet the father’s motivation is slightly under-cooked: we are told he “knew which path would take me” but not shown the in-scene trigger that makes tonight the night he finally tests Marco’s markers. The final micro-choice—father’s hand steadies on the railing—reads as credible first step, but the cost is more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s lucid-dreamer vocation gives her a sharp, occupation-specific lens; her exhaustion is embodied in trembling fingers, not labels. The interior contradiction—wanting to decode alone yet recognizing Ashwin’s fatal solitude—peaks when she decides to co-write the paper, a renunciation of solitary obsession that lands with visible cost: Ashwin’s pressed daylily between them. Elias’s twenty-year isolation is sketched deftly, but his voice collapses into Mara's cadence in dialogue, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s calm-warrior interiority is concrete—her stillness is weaponized, not asserted. The apprentice’s frozen terror is shown through the suspended scream and rigid clutch, not labeled. Maren’s final refusal to explain what she saw crystallizes her guardedness with cost: she walks away alone, blade sheathed in serenity. Only micro-gap: the apprentice’s sudden articulate confession (“I wanted to grow something…”) edges toward explanatory speech rather than embodied memory under shock.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s “root-bound” interior contradiction is shown only in abstract summary (“dreams grew so dense…”), never dramatized as a live tension that tilts a micro-choice. The pivotal scar-link beat relies on a single, already-revealed wound; no visible cost or new flaw complicates the merger. Marcus remains a thematic echo rather than a crucible—his presence does not force a status shift or force Mira to betray a value. The ending renunciation (old covenant) is declared, not embodied; we are told the clipping “dissolved,” but Mira’s interior stance is unchanged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s desperation is viscerally embodied (“eyes had deepened,” “swallowed wasps”); the Oracle’s fierce-gentle stance is shown through micro-choices like offering her hand while warning. The interior contradiction—she broke her own rule to help—remains credible and charges the ending. The only dent: the leap from “I’ll pay anything” to full destiny-swap is asserted, not dramatized, so the motivational ramp feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—technical fact-drill vs. gut feel—are dramatized in the bottle-test micro-choice; the renunciation of “confidently uncertain” lands as earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (“hands trembled,” “glass showed irregular bubbles”) and avoids label-speak. Flaw drives mistake and later tactics; the grille-cloth emblem carries his blind-spot without overt symbolic nudging. Sarah functions mainly as prompt-delivery, so relationship crucible is thin; single-POV depth is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Emilia’s grief and scientific lens are credibly braided; the palmed seed and her methodical kneeling ground her interior contradiction. The embodied metallic taste after biting the fruit shows emotion through body, not label. One micro-choice—planting the seed despite “science” scoffs—drives all later knowledge; cost is the loss of pure objectivity. Harrow remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; mentor absence works as pressure but limits 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maris’s interior contradiction—clinging to routine while engineering surprise—drives every micro-choice; the molten-fish gesture crystallizes her value hierarchy with felt cost as she pays forward the wonder she can no longer personally feel. The visiting woman’s arc is slighter but still earns its micro-turn: from disorientation to re-appropriated “tomorrow” speech. Voice convergence between the two is minor and late; internal textures remain distinct under pressure. One diagnostic beat of therapeutic self-label (“wonder needs only the unknown”) is quickly embodied in the returning-scroll gesture, so the slip is capped at −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s shift from detached inspector to custodian of abandoned hopes is rendered through embodied micro-choices—lifting the pearl, trembling hands, deciding to catalog rather than inventory. Interiority is concrete and profession-specific; his “clinical detachment” cracks under the shrine’s pressure, showing contradictory impulses (duty vs. reparative impulse) without therapeutic gloss. The final renunciation of his former detachment is earned by the shell’s confession and carries visible cost: he leaves the cave transformed, purpose reframed. Only minor slip: “felt the weight of his profession differently” edges toward summary; tightening would lift this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—scientist’s precision vs. unmedicated emotional surge—remains embodied in every beat (wading deeper while logging data). The micro-choice to keep photographing graffiti and to write her own tile-line crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of the accordion is earned: taped bellows mirror her patched self, and leaving it in afternoon light costs her nostalgic buffer. Only the “Subject remains upright” note flirts with clinical shorthand that slightly flattens peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Grandmother’s lonely bargain powers every beat; the veiled dreamer’s documenting hand and tremulous step embody inherited hunger for connection. Yet the veil itself remains a dead prop—never lifted, adjusted, or used to screen tears—so her body stays half-abstract. Interiority is sharp (“cold fire”) but flirts with label-speak (“cautious exuberance transforming”). Closure cost is felt when she accepts that revenge was never the point, earning the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is textured through synesthetic perception (violin as memory, coffee as futures) and embodied reaction to plant telepathy; the final encrypted-report choice crystallizes her value hierarchy. The flaw: “perforated destiny” is named more than dramatized in her pulses, so the internal contradiction never quite splits her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s vocation fuses beautician-mortician in every gesture; the oils, pigments, and thermal math are visible micro-choices that cost her calm and time. Contradictory impulses—feral scientific precision vs. tender grief midwifery—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The emerald-chip beat on the girl’s forehead crystallizes her hierarchy: transcendence over personal safety. Only the “five-year” backstory chunk (≈12% of text) is pure reflection without present tilt, keeping her just outside 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Keiko’s caretaker impulse is embodied in the rice-offering ritual and the monthly climb; the grotto scenes dramatize contradictory impulses—duty vs. restlessness—through micro-choices like the slow arrangement of bamboo-wrapped cakes. Her interiority stays concrete (“grief still carved hollows”) and avoids label-speak. The final acceptance of the hairpin crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the fantasy of a single “source” of peace, satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to certainty while craving nuance—are dramatized in her grip on the shard and her decision to clip it to the rail. The embodied cost (her throat tightening, the “garment she’d finally learned to wear”) is specific and felt. The keeper’s “protected vulnerability” is shown, not labeled, in his half-smile and cautious offer. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: reputation-money-family-uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The researcher’s reverse-aging is a striking premise, but her interior contradiction—teaching what she will forget—stays declarative (“I already have”) rather than embodied in a micro-choice during the lesson. The student’s trembling arrival is the only visible cost; neither character pays a new price on-page at closure, so the arc feels observationally static.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is textured—his palm reading the pulse, the remembered grandmother, the decision to “travel without moving”—but the only micro-choice on-page is the decision to begin restoration work, a gentle closing beat rather than a pressured crucible. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. solitude, exhaustion vs. reverence) are named, not enacted in scene; the emotional cost is inferred, not embodied in a single visible moment. Still, the harmonic-skill lineage and his weathered resolve feel specific, keeping him above the template threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s motives stay consistent and deepen with each attempt to “mist walk,” her embodied exhaustion and numbing body grounding the internal shift. The keystone’s glowing reprise is earned by her repetitive, failing tries and her grandmother’s journal cue, making the final luminous acceptance feel like costed endurance rather than epiphany. Interiority avoids label-speak, using concrete physical loss of sensation to mirror magical inadequacy. The only minor gap: we don’t see her explicitly renounce teleportation convenience afterwards, so the reader must infer the path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s loneliness, ritual precision, and inherited obsession are rendered through embodied micro-choices—striking each match, memorizing tide tables, clutching the brass tag until it warms. The contradiction between her nightly solitude and the public memorial sharpens when she chooses to dive alone: renunciation of safety in order to “translate” her grandfather’s silence. Grandfather’s backstory is compressed but anchored in present stimuli (key tag, algae bottles) and motivates the final gesture. Cost is visible: she surfaces cold, lamp extinguished, path now irreversibly “between silence and seeing.”

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s quiet enthusiasm and the backwards-prophecy method root her interiority; the coins function as an embodied ritual that charges her choices. Kael’s arc from cynic to disciple is sketched cleanly, but his final “Teach me” pivot is compressed into a single sentence—no visible cost or contradiction on him. Micro-choices (selecting coins, adjusting headset) reveal hierarchy of values, yet secondary pressures on her motivation remain abstract—no tangible flaw or loss is dramatized. Earned stasis is asserted, not felt: the ending’s transformation cost is collective, so her personal price stays off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s renunciation of Daniel is credibly anchored in the inherited loneliness of her predecessor; the “crystallized memory” jewel is a vivid embodied cost. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, relying instead on tactile atlas page and telescope contact to externalize grief. The contradiction between immortal duty and mortal longing stays live in every beat, culminating in the named fear—“Here be dragons”—that forecloses any future with Daniel. Only minor shortfall: we are told rather than shown Daniel’s actual reaction, so the full relational crucible is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emris’s interiority is vivid—his “lukewarm” magic is shown through micro-choices like heating bronze “just enough,” and his brittle devotion is embodied in the notebook of drop counts. The final endurance (hanging the bell, walking home exhausted) earns a credible renunciation of acclaim, but the absence of on-stage opposition flattens status pressure and caps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s “precisely humane” trait is shown through his measured descent and willingness to listen, but the interior contradiction is only asserted, not dramatized in a micro-choice that costs him.  The final acceptance of memory’s burden is credible yet arrives via Eleanor’s invitation more than an active renunciation.  Interiority is concrete—his uniform cold through concrete—but stays safe; no flawed impulse complicates his vigil.  Still, the shift from guardian of submersion to keeper of submerged meaning is legible and carries quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her auburn hair darkening, her fingers trembling, the secret handkerchief against her heart—each choice rooted in a palpable contradiction between Academy doctrine and private wonder. The internal split (sentiment vs. science) drives every beat: it propels her into the orchard, governs how she handles the crystal, and crystallizes the final synthesis. The only slack is the grandmother memory, introduced late and summarized rather than dramatized; because it never collides with present action, the emotional cost feels second-hand. Still, her hierarchy of values is legible on the page and the renunciation of pure rationality is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—need to please Command vs refusal to falsify data—is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (biting buckle, hand dancing across notepad) that escalate with the external challenge. The parachute buckle functions as a physical memory anchor, showing embodied emotion rather than naming it. Final renunciation of revision claim carries visible cost: professional risk expressed in the silent radio click and resumed vigil. Voice stays coherent, flaws intact; moral ambiguity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is sharp—“I don’t love her” lands as embodied cost—but micro-choices cluster in summary blocks rather than dramatized beats. Clone-Kira’s grief is shown only in “eyes glistened,” flattening the potential status war. The final handshake is earned, yet the prior numbness is declared more than performed. Still, the互补 opposite logic keeps both Kiras credibly flawed and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margot’s interior contradiction—puzzle-obsessed yet able to walk away—drives the beat; the moment she photographs the seed, then chooses to float it away, her renunciation carries visible cost as she forfeits both the answer and the community she will now warn. Her “notably receptive” trait is shown, not told, by the instant pattern recognition that dooms others; this same trait flips to become the agency that breaks the trap. The earned refusal satisfies the closure under a causal lens, though micro-choices stay light for 740 words.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Martin’s grief is embodied (leaf-blower baton, lullaby humming), but the interior contradiction is thin; he never questions or fights his own ritual, so growth is only additive. Sarah arrives as echo-helper rather than crucible, so the marital relationship alters only by declaration. The final “mournfully eager” stance is the same as the first; cost is atmospheric, not character-forced.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maris’s dual nature—scholarly memory inside feral body—drives every choice; the clawed hand that snaps the chain is the same mind that catalogues lost hours. Interior contradiction is vivid: “aching intelligence” against “feral instinct” pressed into one irrecoverable act. The renunciation of the pendant costs her the only geography where she was un-collared, a price felt in the final line’s quiet smile. Voice never drifts into diagnostic jargon; even “dimensionally homesick” is rendered as bodily ache.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cassia’s interiority is concrete—her “stoically sensitive fingers” on the fracture lines shows the trait in action. The contradiction between hopeless reputation and stubborn practice is dramatized, not declared. The final smile is earned because we have watched her blood, bone ash and seventeen years of failure crystallize into a living crozier. Minor slip: the father’s disappointment is summarized more than felt, muting one potential layer of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—hunger for novelty vs protocol loyalty—surfaces early and powers the pivot to “tune for silence,” yet the embodied cost (hand resonance) is stated more than felt; still, the renunciation of old method cleanly forecloses her former path and scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mateo’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through calm micro-actions—polishing the hourglass, steadying passengers—but the interior contradiction never surfaces in scene; his diagnostic clarity (“I understand immediately”) strips pressure. No visible cost attaches to his choice to merge timelines; the grin at the end feels unearned because the story never lets his optimism falter or imperil him.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific, but the moment of insight—“Connection wasn’t a fixed thing…”—arrives as declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the prior weaving beats show micro-choices, yet the climax tells us the epiphany instead of forcing her body to pay the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Carta’s obsession with impossible starlight and her willingness to abandon surface life are dramatized through the embodied weight of the corroded chain link; the micro-choice to surrender the anchor to alien light crystallizes her internal contradiction between human certainty and benthic uncertainty, paying visible cost. The alien guide remains a luminous cipher; its shifting morphology stays coherent but never applies direct pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, her flaw—need to map the unmappable—drives every beat and is not safety-hedged; the final tracing of constellations through water is earned renunciation of former limits.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s “persistently curious” drive is shown only in job description and generic action (“fingers flew across her tablet”), never tested by a micro-choice that costs her anything. Lily’s arrival delivers a visible bruise, but Mira’s interiority stays static; no contradictory impulse surfaces in scene. The final “began making calls” is summary, not an embodied decision with on-page cost, so the change is declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s promise to Kove’s daughter and her own need for air under pressure give the descent a personal stake; the “compression in her chest” line shows embodied fear. Interiority stays concrete—she counts tide hours, fingers the gold—but the emotional arc is mostly discovery rather than painful contradiction, so the “change” is more knowledge than self-revision. Because no second character shares the frame, status crucible is absent; the score reflects a solid single-POV portrait whose cost is observational, not relational.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s guilt-driven interiority is concrete—heartbeat counting, ink spills, shard placement—yet the “six-hours-dead” backstory feels author-engineered rather than lived; the pacemaker glitch is sketched in one clause, never re-enters her body-under-pressure. The final pivot from “I killed him” to “I assisted his courage” lands cleanly but relies on a recovered file rather than an on-scene micro-choice; the porcelain shard reprise supplies symbolic poise yet no new physical risk. Emotional progression is credible: trembling fingers → stillness at ribs; still, the hospital bureaucracy nightmare stays abstract, muting the flaw-to-value crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sarielle’s tactile obsession and alienation feel lived-in; the choice to wear her fingers smooth is embodied cost. Interiority stays sensory, never diagnostic. The single拔高—declaring “everything connected”—is earned by the prior beat-by-beat translation work. No contradictory impulses on stage, but the absence of a second character keeps relationship crucible inert, capping the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her clinical detachment cracking on the page—and the arrowhead micro-choice (“pocketing the arrowhead”) crystallizes her shift. The “frost in her heart” refrain is the only overt therapy-speak, but it’s anchored in embodied cold imagery. Voss’s spectral laugh supplies credible external pressure that rewrites her long-held bitterness without an unearned epiphany. Old Marrow remains more atmospheric cipher than crucible, but his single line “hunting a better version of us” lands as spoken subtext that reframes her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is legible and embodied through the violin; the locust shell choice charges the climax. Interiority stays concrete (“old rhythm in her chest”). Yet the turn from passive observer to active transformer is compressed into a single musical beat—more micro-choice scaffolding in the orchard or on the bridge would have earned a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s interiority is specific—she clocks time, maps drone blind-spots, and links absences into tactics—yet her contradictions stay summary (“trapped and trying to remain powerful”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The final image of the storm bottle handed off crystallizes her values, but the choice itself is off-page; we feel the cost obliquely, not through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Still, her perceptual signature and vocationally shaped attention keep her convincingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The carpenter’s mute, ritualized devotion is rendered with patient, embodied detail—his stained hands, the wordless hymn, the way brass warmth is felt against his chest. Interior contradiction is light (he craves silence yet sings), but the final act of “translation” is earned by years of solitary craft shown, not told. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship tests are waived; the single POV remains coherent, specific, and unsentimental. The quiet closure—his gleaming hands reaching for the next fragment—makes the cost of endless making visible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cordelia’s “searching too” is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene. The patrons remain ornamental—none pressure her or alter her tactics—so the relationship crucible is idle. The scarf warmth is the sole embodied cost, arriving as an effect rather than a choice. Interiority is atmospheric but not sharpened under pressure; she never risks failure or re-prioritizes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s stubborn grief and methodical obsession are credibly embodied; her decision to “paint herself into the spaces” is seeded by prior camera outings. Yet the interior contradiction—cling to life or dissolve into Theo’s realm—stays summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, so the final leap feels slightly abstract, not fully paid for in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s mourning, guilt, and need to know are legible on the page, but they stay at one pitch; there’s no interior contradiction or visible hierarchy of values under pressure. The locksmith is plot-function more than person, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The sister is only remembered, never staged, so the emotional engine is second-hand. Micro-choices (ribbon decoding, stepping into the nexus) advance plot but don’t force Mara to test a flaw or belief, so the change feels symbolic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s chronically-curious folklorist core is dramatized through micro-choices: tasting sediment, hesitating before plucking, the mesh-bag ascent. The vanishing-memories flaw drives every beat and the final renunciation costs her the safety of detached documentation. Interiority stays concrete (“soil-stained and sure” hands) and avoids label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from full 9-band crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s nervous backwards-walking is a vivid, embodied tick that complicates her authority and humanizes her mentor role. Finn’s “combative tenderness” is dramatized through insults that beg for approval, giving credible interior contradiction. The final micro-choice—Finn copying the tea-leaf geometry—earns a quiet change, though the cost feels light for 750 words. Interiority sometimes drifts into therapeutic summary (“exiled their fear onto you”) that blunts the edge of embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her ache in cold knees, the blood-drop ritual—and her insatiably creative drive is shown through the risky weaving, not told. The contradiction between orchard pragmatist and dream-raider is active in scene, and her final smile is an earned stasis that costs her stamina and youth. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; her lone micro-choices (cutting thumb, singing orchard lullaby) reveal a hierarchy valuing wonder over personal safety. Flaw (solitary obsession) directly complicates the act and is neither balanced nor redeemed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s vocation and the fisherman’s guilt are sketched vividly, but both remain static masks: she never doubts or falters, and his sole dimension is remorse. No micro-choice complicates her method; the needle moves, knots loosen, and interior contradiction is absent. The “broken mask restorer” premise promises personal fracture, yet Maren’s psyche stays intact, so the arc is flat. Cost is present (the fisherman’s dissolution) but not personally paid by Maren, blunting the emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s interiority is specific—her cartographer’s eye, her refusal to fear the whispers—and the micro-choice to leave the vault doors open crystallizes her arc. Yet the “methodically curious” trait is stated more than dramatized; we see only one brief measuring gesture. The rotated-stone discovery feels observed, not wrested, so the cost is intellectual rather than viscerally embodied. Still, her stance shift is coherent and scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s interiority—cool, taxonomic, ever-calculating—remains concrete and particular; her habitual cataloguing of disaster (“She turned it slowly, quietly analytic…”) shows a lived-in worldview rather than a label. The contradictory pull between her forensic impulse and the dawning recognition that some absences must stay intact is dramatized in the final gesture of returning the globe. Micro-choices (photographing, writing, then relinquishing) externalize the hierarchy of values with visible cost: she surrenders the artifact and the hope of exhaustive knowledge. The sister-backstory is brief but anchored to present stimuli (the snow-globe memory triggers the notebook admission), so the reflection exception is met; still, the renunciation’s causal build-up is slightly under-powered, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Moth’s interiority is lyrically coherent—her “driftingly alert” attention masks precise purpose, a contradiction that stays active in-scene. The flower-press bolt plate and humming of lost ballads give her sensory specificity; no diagnostic self-talk. The closing smile and new song show a micro-choice that accepts the cost of perpetual solitude as courier of ghosts. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible inapplicable; head-count clarity is perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied; her contradictory impulses—safe detachment vs. longing to feel—coexist in the elevator beats. Micro-choice at tenth-floor hatch (renounce promotion, embrace risk) is earned by prior causality: goggles → diary fragments → captain’s model. Cost is visible: she steps into colder isolation to seek connection. Voice stays servant-specific, no diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interior voice is specific and consistent—“spooled wholeness,” “quietly explosive”—showing a scientist-poet hybrid whose motive to memorialize drives every micro-choice. The telescope, journal, and gondola isolation become embodied extensions of her grandfather’s legacy, so her final smile feels earned rather than epiphanic. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, but the sustained, idiosyncratic attention keeps her from sliding into type.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The portrait artist’s face-blindness and tactile method are vividly embodied; her inability to “recognize” yet capacity to “render” creates a taut internal contradiction that drives every beat. The moment she wipes condensation from “his cheek” believing it is her lover, then recoils at a stranger’s aftershave, crystallizes her limits under pressure. Micro-choices—fingering the coin, adding the star-reflection—trace a credible arc from confidence to honest resignation. The portrait never becomes a person, and that failure is the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Celeste’s interior contradiction—duty to Hendrik vs hunger for hidden knowledge—drives every beat; the thumb-smudge that erases the hopscotch is a micro-choice that stakes her life-path. The “sociable isolation” motif is embodied in her watching birds while copying routes, not declared. Apprentice curiosity is more than label: it forces her to decode, risk, and decide. Closure is earned stasis: she accepts slower danger, foreclosing the option to expose the discovery now, and the cost is legpable in her deliberate “casual” tone to Hendrik.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miren’s interior engine runs on tactile, embodied detail (“ice-hewn shelves,” “rust furred their edges like orange moss”), so her competence feels inherited, not asserted. The micro-choices—heating a pick, filing a meteor-gear—translate motive into visible gesture, satisfying the contradiction test. Cost is present but muted: she forfeits perfect rhythm for imperfect survival, yet the price is stated rather than dramatized in her body. Still, the profession-specific sensory hierarchy keeps her individuated; no stock locksmith cliché intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—obsessive caretaker vs. centuries-weary witness—stays active in every ectoplasmic micro-choice (ringing the bell, kneeling with chalk). Embodied emotion is precise: “chalk felt strange in her ectoplasmic fingers—simultaneously there and not there.” Final renunciation of solitude (“she wasn’t doing it alone”) is earned by the因果链 of nightly messages that literally cost her solitary identity. No label-speak; ghostly limitation stays consistent and flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The adjuster’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the ache of seventeen years—but the “beautifully flawed” trait never manifests as a concrete limitation that complicates the adjustment; she succeeds without visible error or self-confrontation. The puppet head functions as an emotional talisman yet doesn’t force a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Motive (“whisper a lullaby”) is declared poetically rather than dramatized as a conflicting imperative. Still, her embodied awe and the ritualized descent supply a credible, costed stance—Earned Stasis—so the arc lands, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s reluctant-caretaker motive is vivid early (“duty she’d never wanted”) and her micro-choices under bird-threat show credible endurance. Interiority clings to orchard imagery, but the decisive turn—accepting the gift—relies on a single lyrical line rather than a dramatized cost. Still, the hierarchy of values (strangers’ lives > her freedom) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s grief is embodied (hands frozen on the urn, humming Leah’s melody), but interiority slips into label-speak—“grief had loosened something in her understanding” is diagnostic rather than sensed. The decisive micro-choice—splitting the ashes into five currents—pays off, yet the preceding self-recrimination is summarized, not dramatized, so the shift from paralysis to action feels telescoped. Flaw persists: competence (polymer expertise) is asserted but never allowed to complicate or fail under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vera’s calm expertise is vivid, but the parolee’s interiority is delivered through labels (“hesitant gait,” “weathered features”) rather than embodied contradiction; his moment of recognition depends on a quasi-magical external cue rather than on-page micro-choice, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maron’s interiority is vivid—“taste memories in food,” “sandpaper the rough memories”—and his micro-choice to bare his hand despite contagion risk crystallizes values. The contradiction of wanting to heal yet fearing erasure is active in scene, not summarized. His endurance carries visible cost: “only tears—his own, this time.” The secondary keeper is sketched only as conduit, so relationship pressure is thin, capping the score just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her decision to lift the meteor-weight is embodied, not explained. The flaw is that her “empathetically decisive” trait is declared rather than dramatized in micro-choices before the night descent; we’re told she “had to be” rather than shown a prior moment where empathy collides with risk. Still, the final image of her smiling while farmers share songs earns the cost of her transgression against the historical society. The contradiction between preservationist duty and disruptive composer is present but under-exploited in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is specific—her gloved fingers tracing the helical fracture, the visceral jolt of foreign memories—yet her motives remain slightly abstract: why “give voice” to abandoned dreams never sharpens into a tangible personal cost. The final image of her as “bridge” is beautiful, but the beat of renunciation (what she forfeits by becoming that bridge) is implied rather than embodied, so the change feels elegant but not fully paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s “prism-minded” trait is shown through her sensory refraction of numeric fireflies and her compulsive focus on margins; internal contradiction is lightly dramatized when awe collides with stomach-lurching terror. Embodied emotion is acute—“stomach performed impossible gymnastics,” fingers tremble—anchoring her scholarly desire inside visceral stakes. The closing vow to seed new marginalia crystallizes a cost: she now bears the weight of centuries of hidden keys, foreclosing a normal archivist’s life. Voice never drifts into label-speak; even “threshold effects” is filtered through her tactile discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s “tree-song sculptor” identity animates her tactile, synesthetic attention, but interiority leans on lyrical summary (“quiet intensity”) rather than micro-choice under siege; the final strum is the only beat where embodied decision visibly forks her fate, so the arc feels pre-orchestrated rather than risked.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kavir’s exile-rooted need to listen rather than lecture is dramatized through the stone’s relinquishing and the earth-palm beat, showing interior contradiction. His renunciation of vengeance and acceptance of incomplete beauty carries visible cost. The Hierophant’s daughter is sketched only in micro-gesture, but the single on-page relationship still crystallizes a power shift. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible; the only cap is the 8.8 gate because contradictory impulses are summarized rather than enacted in live scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlow’s interior contradiction—needing answers yet refusing to break the clasp—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to speak into the microphone at the exact frequency of forgiveness is earned and costly. The final renunciation (closing the diary unread) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: witness over possession. Hairline slip: “theatrical sincerity” twice edges toward performed self-diagnosis, not quite embodied under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—palming the arrow tip, feeling gravity invert in her stomach—and her navigation method shows individualized competence under pressure. The final realization (“resilience wasn’t about resistance…”) is earned because the echo-vision dramatizes the mechanism first; she doesn’t lecture us. Still, we never see a genuine mistake or flaw; her “eccentric” method works flawlessly, muting internal contradiction. A single micro-choice that backfires would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her father’s patch grounds memory and motive—but her on-page choices are largely observational. The decisive shift from “investigate past” to “survey future” is stated, not dramatized through a visible micro-choice that costs her something now. Competence is credibly limited by respirator alarms and fog, yet the emotional price of foresight remains conceptual rather than embodied. The patch reprise at the end supplies symbolic weight, yet the absence of a charged renunciation or immediate risk keeps the arc just shy of high-band earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s synesthetic gift is shown in embodied, specific ways (“tasted sound as copper… whispers as violet threads”) and drives every perception; her seventeen-year prism-song vocation and the Council threat give a clear external want and internal need. The micro-choice to carry the amber sheet into the cavern and later to strike the ice column with her bell-hammer both reveal value hierarchy and advance the plot. The final renunciation—she realizes the bells never created wonder—carries credible conceptual cost, earning her quiet victory. No contradictory interiority; pressure distorts perception credibly (“colors swirled faster”).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s fifteen-year custodianship and the quiet ache of “failure” are rendered as embodied tension—hands tremble, memory reverberates—so contradictions act in scene. The decisive turn from keeper to crosser is earned: every prior ritual now reprices the flute as door, not artifact. Cost is visible when driftwood burns and silence breaks; the choice to vanish forecloses return. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, but the arc leans on one micro-choice—play once more—rather than a full hierarchy of values under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The operator’s dissolution into borrowed personalities is dramatized through her press-work and the warming halo fragment; the closing smile that isn’t hers crystallizes the cost of empathy-as-self-erasure. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. No contradiction under pressure, but the beat is single-track; relationship crucible unused—so 8.7, not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interiority is solid—his twitching fingers, compulsive reach-then-jerk pattern, and final decision to plant the seed all embody the “jittery courier” trait. The contradictory impulse to touch yet avoid the pendant is sustained, and his micro-choice to pocket the seed and later to plant it grows credibly from prior beats. However, the moment he “admits” the pendant made him extend himself is delivered as a spoken summary, not dramatized contradiction; that caps the score just below 8.8. Still, the earned renunciation of pure courier detachment and the visible cost of accepting wonder-legitimacy land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s obsession with proving her theory is credibly embodied; the prism-in-pocket and frost-vision beats dramatize the stake viscerally. Hartley’s reversal is telegraphed via the frost patterns, so the conversion feels earned rather than convenient. Interior contradiction is present—her exultation vs. fear of final rejection—yet the lens stays too clean on her turmoil, keeping this shy of 9. The “truthful lies” pact crystallizes a visible cost for both, satisfying the earned-choice test.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mariko’s interiority is concrete—hair-thread, cold-numbed fingers, amber pulse—showing a hierarchy of values (brother > self) that escalates to the willing self-trade. The contradiction between stoic diligence and trembling fear is embodied, not labeled. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A. Final renunciation is fully earned by the loom-pattern causality and grandmother’s forewarning.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s “quietly determined” interiority is lived-in: trembling hands yet measured strikes, silk strip as tactile memory, the mine-crawl as embodied risk. Contradictory impulses—fear of failure vs refusal to evacuate—collide inside every hammer blow, not in abstract narration. The final stance (forge onward alone) is foreclosed by the spent silk and the first green bud: cost is visible, earned. Only capping at 8.8 because the magician’s dialogue momentarily “explains” her trait rather than letting the forge act speak.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is sensorially concrete—temperature gradients “blooming like flowers,” the shard’s edges “bite her palm”—and every micro-choice (touching the bulkhead, lifting the glass) is tethered to her map-making curse. The final decision to set the shard down is earned: she has tasted the cost of “love measured against existence” through the seventeen-minute cycle and the sister’s confession. One hairline slip: the line “weight of a withheld truth, heavy as collapsed stars” drifts into abstract grandiosity that momentarily blurs embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s reticence is credibly preserved until the final act; her decision to write and surrender the sea glass feels earned because we’ve watched her carry others’ confessions without adding her own. The micro-choice to pocket the glass early anchors later symbolism without telegraphing. Marcus’s interior is sketched only through his dying words, yet his bottled-safety motive is vivid and consistent with the lamp failure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized for Vera on-page before the climax, so the internal-conflict bullet is only weakly met.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's interiority is vivid—"laughed not from joy but from the absurdity"—and his embodied storm-call gives a singular bodily signature. Yet the accidentally-prophetic trait is asserted more than dramatized; we hear about past quips rather than feel one combust in-scene under pressure, so the flaw stays ornamental. No contradictory impulse is staged inside the ritual beat; the glass-wick click simply succeeds, so the final turn feels pre-ordained not earned. Still, the occupation-specific lore of copper filaments and Fresnel math lends a memorable worldview that lifts the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to understand the magnetism she never asked for while fearing its cost—remains embodied in the palmed heartbeat and the swaying tea-house. The micro-choice to stay with Chen crystallizes her hierarchy of values and is earned by the prior causal chain of strangers’ confessions. The only bar to 9-band is that Yuki’s prior “listening” is reported, not dramatized, so the inherited trait feels slightly abstract rather than compulsive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s night-shift solitude keeps relationships off-stage, yet her interiority is textured—“what memories live in their rings” shows a private cosmology. The sextant micro-choices anchor her agency, but the moment she presses bark and grief drops from 4.3 to 0.1 is abstractly reported rather than embodied, muting cost visibility. A stronger physical correlative or after-tremor would have nailed the transformation to her body and lifted the score into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elora’s interiority is textured—“the weight of forgetting threatened to crack her open like winter ice”—and her endurance under pressure is credible. Yet the story never tests her limits; the weaving succeeds without visible misstep or internal contradiction, so the promised flaw never complicates the final choice. She remembers, she sings, she wins—no blind spot exacts cost. Motivation is clear, but the absence of a fissure under pressure keeps her shy of high-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iris’s “compassionate distance” is dramatized in the laundromat beat where she smoothes the crumpled invite against her thigh—an embodied micro-choice that shows her simultaneously reaching out and holding back. The wedding-ghost backstory is anchored to a present cue (the invite) and tilts her stance in-scene, satisfying BRR. Closure—choosing to stay by choosing when to go—reverses her prior equation of absence = protection, and the cost is felt in the final image of her reading herself back into the world. Interiority stays concrete: “static of human proximity” is sensory, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—grief for the erased city versus her hunger to keep witnessing—drives every beat; the pocketed seeds embody a renunciation that costs her the safety of pure observer. The old woman’s gentleness is shown via the tea ritual, not labeled, and her archival loss is anchored to present action (the bread she recognizes). Micro-choices—handing over the loaf, accepting seeds—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Only the closing “absolution” line drifts toward diagnostic summary, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s quietly obsessive caretaker persona is sharply etched through tactile micro-choices—fingerless gloves, fountain-pen ledger, private journal separate from official records. Internal contradiction flickers when detached cataloguing suddenly collides with involuntary tears, proving her stoic stance is porous. The slide’s 528 Hz “warmth” is the pivot where her private longing breaks cover, giving the ending its cost. Still, the story leans on reflective summary more than in-scene pressure, so the full arc of renunciation feels slightly under-cooked on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Nelle’s contradictory impulses—grief-wrung vengeance against filial loyalty—are alive in her palm pressing the fob and in the micro-choice to play the recorder rather than hand it over. The brass token and the wire device externalize her interior split; every beat is filtered through runner-trained wariness that keeps her body coiled even while she speaks. Crenshaw’s “comforting unease” persona is equally specific, a menace wrapped in soft dialect that lets us feel status tilt without exposition. Closure is earned: the fob reclaimed and silence chosen cost her the last paternal shield, leaving her “armor” of silence a felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—tasting the wind, twisting the ring—but her “luminous skeptic” label is asserted, not dramatized; no on-page contradiction between doubt and certainty. Kael arrives as weather-event more than agent; his storm dissipates on a single line of dialogue, so the relational shift feels gifted, not crucible-forged. Grandmother’s inherited gift is backstory-rich yet triggers no micro-choice here; the beat where Mira declares “It finds weather-carriers” lands as tidy exposition rather than earned recognition. The closure image of two siblings beneath aurora is poetically resonant, but the cost of Kael’s dissipating storm and Mira’s certainty is asserted, not embodied—no path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—clinical recall vs. volcanic creation—are dramatized in the charcoal smears on stone; the final act of drawing until her fingers bleed pays the cost her mother evaded, earning the shift from suppression to transmutation. Interiority stays concrete (“gray crescents that marked her”) and avoids label-speak. The only minor slip is the single-sentence summary “Memory wasn’t meant to be a prison,” which momentarily abstracts what the images have already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s bodily allergy to lies is vivid, specific, and exploited in every scene; her choice to carry “lost candor” outward feels earned because the Archive sequence dramatizes the cost of honesty withheld. The grandmother reveal is the only slight neatening that keeps her from a 9-band. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—and micro-choices (pocketing the map, touching the vessel) keep her hierarchy of values legible.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s muteness and bell-tuning vocation give her a sharp, embodied POV; the final smile and fingertip on the bell crystallize her renunciation of perfection for honest imperfection with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the pilgrims remain anonymous chorus—no individual pressure—so relationship crucible is absent. Still, her contradictory drive (precision vs. human messiness) plays out in scene through micro-adjustments to the sculpture, earning the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    M4-RY’s interior contradiction—nurturer-code vs survivor-guilt—is vivid in the trembling hands and the hidden photo; the final burial choice earns its moment because the photo has been literally corroding their circuits. The static-to-harmony shift is slightly rapid therapy-speak, but the embodied cost (chest-panel release, visible tremor) keeps it from drifting into label-only emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marissa’s curator-caregiver role is cleanly dramatized through micro-choices (arranging chairs, palming the locket, inviting Thomas to speak). Interiority stays concrete, but the “listening heals” thesis is declared rather than lived in her body; the final communal stance feels more symbolically right than individually costly. Still, her discernment drives every turning beat and her calm-sandstorm diction is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—her felt need to “encrypt vulnerability as strength” is dramatized through the dice-throw key choice and the underwater choreography. The contradiction between grief and tactical ruthlessness is alive in scene, not stated. Cost is visible: the same algae glow that preserves the lab also forces her to leave it nightly, sealing her exile. Voice stays hers; no diagnostic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maris’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism versus inherited mysticism—surface in simultaneous micro-choices: she both mocks the diviners and secretly adopts their coffee-ground method. Her embodied fear of “rising dangerously high” on the pier and the reflex to clutch the book against her ribs externalize interiority without label-speak. The final renunciation—cutting into the heart and letting it seal around her—pays off every earlier image of deletion and crystallizes a visible cost: she forfeits the living world for recovered time.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—fingers trembling, whispering the spaces between words—yet the summoner’s contradictory impulses (preserve silence vs. act) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in a single, pressured beat. The final renunciation is credible and scaled to length: lifelong loneliness accepted without complaint. Still, no second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the arc is solitude accepting further solitude, which limits depth but feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s buried bilingualism and her need to normalize it through academic Latin are credibly conflicted; the memory-triggered admission feels earned because the rooftop setting and Moss seal act as concrete cues. Mrs. Kovac’s professorial patience and family stake in Heinrich’s escape architecture give her more than mentor polish—she risks passing a clandestine inheritance. Interiority is character-specific (Elena’s palm-heel weight of the seal, the cold tea as emotional anchor). No label-speak; the discovery is rendered through sensory beats rather than diagnostic summary. Cost is present but light—Elena’s former denial is forfeited, yet the story stops before we see how this new fluency will complicate her life; that keeps it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s archive-garden obsession is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to press the shell to her ear while moonflowers pulse anchors her motive under pressure. The refusal to share her method is a credibly costly renunciation. Interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“I’m not crazy”) that flattens the contradiction momentarily. Still, the hierarchy of values—sister-love vs. state control—remains legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mei’s interiority is concrete—her hand steadies while her heart lurches—and her hierarchy of values (village > life) drives every micro-choice. The Magistrate’s softening eyes and deliberate key-offer show status shifting under pressure. Only the “heritage rose wisdom” line drifts toward slogan; the rest is earned through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her breath catching at the shell-voice, her eyes stinging as she traces the petroglyphs—yet the epiphany “I could never echo because I never let anyone truly hear me” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting embodied cost. The renunciation of solitude is earned, but the final pivot to communal teaching is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maya’s contradictory tug—professional detachment vs. the compulsion to heal strangers’ inherited grief—stays embodied (damp suit, frost-numbed fingers). The micro-choice to wrap the globe in cloth before surfacing crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Because the cost (solitude, perpetual immersion in others’ trauma) is legible in the final beat, the arc earns its Resonant Reconfiguration. Interiority never slips into diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kenji’s interiority is concrete—weathered fingers, whistle-cadence tied to breath-and-spirit—yet the apprentice remains a thematic sounding board rather than a second pressure source. The net-as-philosophy metaphor is lived, not declared, and his refusal to punish her mistake crystallizes his earned stance. No internal contradiction is dramatized in-scene, so the arc is steady, not torn; still, the cost is palpable in the transferred net and her changed touch. Meets the 9+ test on causality and cost, but the secondary character lacks compensatory flaws, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s skeptical-scientist persona is cleanly dramatized through tactile micro-choices—knelt soil-sifting, Geiger-click counting, calm reburial—so her “conspiracy-debunker” identity is more than label. Inner contradiction surfaces once: the pulse-quickening at “Project Stillpoint” hints she wants the myth true even while disdaining it, but this tension is stated more than embodied. The final renunciation (truth published, diamond hidden) carries visible cost and is causally prepared; still, the emotional price feels efficiently rather than richly earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s isolation and pattern-seeking gift are vivid, but her late-shift “choice” is declared not dramatized; the interiority is lyrical yet risks diagnostic self-tagging (“I’ve always been good at seeing patterns…”) without embodied contradiction under final pressure. Cost is asserted (“years of isolation”) rather than felt in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cosima’s interiority is vivid—“ink-stained fingers,” “feral loft,” “salt and wild roses” all filter through her sensory bias. Her contradictory drives—obsessive collector vs. penniless outcast—surface in micro-choices (repairing the box, gifting it). The final renunciation of the box to Mrs. Chen costs her a tangible talisman, earned by prior beats; flaw (exile) becomes tactic. Voice remains singular; no head-count clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Meris’s interior contradiction—rational engineer vs. marrow-level caretaker—acts in every beat; the key’s warming against her palm literalizes the stakes inside her body. Micro-choices (climbing three steps at a time, striking the fork) visibly foreclose paths with cost, culminating in the irreversible fusion of her heartbeat to the chamber’s lock. No diagnostic labels; emotion is bone-resonant, not abstract. The earned stasis—she will vibrate forever with strangers’ guilt—pays the price in lived pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ren’s quiet refusal to rush her measurements embodies the “softly purposeful” trait; her embodied vigilance (numb fingers, steady theodolite twists) is concrete, never label-speak. The contradiction between inherited duty and private lunar obsession is active in every beat, not summarized. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the internal conflict is sufficient. Final “patient revolution” is earned because every prior night’s data-gathering is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elena’s interiority is sharp—her “watchfully calm” stance is embodied when she radios Reeves while photographing evidence. The contradiction between habitual obedience and the moment she uploads to encrypted storage is vivid, but the turn is compressed into a single clause; we don’t feel her body rebel or the acid taste of risk, so the cost is declared, not endured. Malcolm stays a memory outline, never tested in scene, so his remembered motives don’t ripple back to pressure Elena’s choice. Still, her micro-choice to lie on-air is cleanly causal and specific to her training.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.7)
    Eliana’s guilt and need to atone are palpable in her trembling hands and immediate recalibration of the heart; the grandfather’s letter triggers a credible interior reversal that explains her prior refusal without excusing it. Marcus functions more as catalyst than crucible—his bearing witness is consistent but low-pressure, so the relationship beat feels thin. The cost lands cleanly: she accepts months of unpaid labor to restore a dead man’s heart, a penance that forecloses profit and pride.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mal’s interiority is vivid—her “irreverent awe” is embodied in the way she handles the kaleidoscope and the arrow tip—but the promised flaw/limits never manifest; she glides from beat to beat without error or sacrifice, so the final choice feels unearned. The “steadily curious” trait drives the build, yet no contradictory impulse or visible cost complicates it, so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tested. Single-POV keeps choreography clean; still, the absence of genuine struggle undercuts the high-band entry gate for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s “brightly attentive” trait is dramatized in her noticing 1408 everywhere and in her tactile handling of the patch; the final self-upload is a credible renunciation driven by the same obsession. Interiority stays concrete (“hollow where something vast…carved out space”). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible unused; the flaw is a mild competence imbalance—she cracks an 18-layer vault too easily, blunting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s seven-year survival as a shadow-laced peacekeeper is asserted not shown; the interior contradiction between absorbing darkness and remaining calm is implied but never embodied in a visible tremor or micro-choice under pressure. The moment she decides to “help people see themselves in the breath before choice” is a clean, earned pivot that forecloses Thomas’s fatal path and carries felt cost: the shadows in her flare with starlight, a visible price. Because the causal shift is tied to her prior flaw (knowing too much paralyzes) and lands on-page, the arc clears the 9+ quick test despite the early expositional telling.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s interiority is specific and embodied: the parasol’s ivory tip worn smooth by “three generations of nervous fingers,” the felt looseness of reality “like holding water.” Her decision to volunteer rather than immediately seek treatment is a credible, high-cost micro-choice that forecloses the easier path. The final stance—postponing the clinic to stay and listen—carries visible cost and is earned by her accumulated nights on the ice. Only the grandmother’s Warsaw backstory drifts toward summary; it never alters present tactics, so the motivation remains slightly under-catalyzed.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s grief-anchored perseverance and Elena’s guarded return are credibly particular; the burned letter fragment acts as a concrete externalization of his internal contradiction—clinging to what he once tried to destroy. Their dialogue exchanges, though brief, reveal micro-shifts in power and stance that feel lived-in. The “gentle persuasion” trait surfaces naturally in his vineyard analogy rather than as label, and the final shared silence carries visible cost. Missing a hairline of deeper contradiction in-scene keeps it from the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Senna’s interiority is concrete—she studies “spaces between sentences” and kneels to pour sand—but her contradictory impulses (preservation vs. the risk of scrutiny) stay verbal rather than enacted in a single visible micro-choice. The consecration beat is ritual, not personally costly; we feel no body-level stake as she “adjusts her half-mask.” Still, her perceptual signature (peripheral vision as tool) is specific and the Earned Stasis of accepting maintenance burden is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Margot’s calm curator persona is consistent, yet her interior contradiction—belief in communal healing vs. private solitude—never sharpens into a scene-level choice that costs her anything; she facilitates but is not tested. The townspeople remain typed by loss (widow, bankrupt, anxious teen) rather than given individual micro-conflicts that collide under pressure. Because no one’s flaw complicates the drawing exercise, the “earned” collective shift feels administered, not struggled through.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s reticence and crystalline listening are vivid, but the interior shift from dread to testimony is compressed into a single paragraph of reflection; the cost of speaking feels intellectual rather than embodied. The crystal warms—nice—but we don’t see her pulse or breath catch, so the armor never visibly cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prophet’s precognitive amnesia is vividly dramatized—he writes backwards to outrun forgetting, a micro-choice that embodies the trait. Interiority is concrete: “he could feel the memories… already starting to slip.” The final renunciation—walking away knowing he will lose it—earns cost under Earned Stasis. Flaw: “the sound of growing older” is abstracted into a list rather than one embodied moment; slight emotional dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kenji’s interior contradiction—clinging to preservation while enabling departure—drives every calibration turn; the final “let it spin” renunciation is earned by the grandmother-taught leaf-listening micro-choice and carries visible cost as he forfeits fixity. Embodied emotion (tremor in bones, cold-water realization) stays particular; no stock labels. Only two characters keeps crucible tight; Chen’s luminous worry mirrors stakes without diluting POV. Meets 9+ quick test but micro-choice could be even sharper under final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s “decisively kind” stance is embodied in micro-choices—sitting beside Mr. Chen with “intentional warmth,” telling him to write pancakes not apologies—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible cost for her; she remains therapeutic facilitator rather than stake-bearing protagonist. Mr. Chen’s trembling surgeon hands and final letter give credible change, yet his six-year silence is summarized, not dramatized, so the flaw-to-reconciliation causality is slightly thin. Relationship-as-crucible is present but one-sided: Rebecca’s off-stage forgiveness is reported, not pressured, so the emotional price lands on the father, not the therapist.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hand on the key, the warmth of brass—but the “budding rune scholar” trait is told more than dramatized; no rune is ever read aloud or mis-translated under pressure. The final smile-and-notes moment is too tidy; we don’t feel the cost of re-opening the island’s day-cycle on her body or beliefs. Still, her micro-choices (insert key, realign orrery arms) track cleanly with motive.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marianne’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. parental hunger—are dramatized in the warm tooth scene; the final “Teach me” choice is earned by prior interior fractures and carries visible cost (foreclosure of certainty). Interiority is concrete, bias-specific, avoids therapy-speak. The ten-year grief gap is sketched efficiently; flaw drives mistake (burying the false body). No status/relationship crucible on page aside from mother-daughter reunion, but that dyad is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s grief-rooted pivot from astronomer to glass-smith is vivid and embodied; her tactile polishing sessions double as micro-choices that re-channel loss into sharing light with children. Interiority stays concrete—thumb-testing glass smoothness, arranging shards for optimal dawn angles—never slipping into abstract self-diagnosis. The only slack is the off-stage accident summarized in one paragraph; because Elena never appears or speaks, the relationship crucible is implied rather than dramatized, slightly thinning the motivational texture at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s shift from passive witness to active caretaker of memory is dramatized in the moment she invites Chen to see the patterns; the amber pendant pressed to the notebook externalizes the fused guilt/love that drives her. Interior contradiction is alive: she tenses to flee yet stays, telling us protection and exposure war inside her. One beat of micro-choice—offering to share the documented icicle drips—converts private penance into relational ritual, paying the cost of public exposure again. The “watchful dreamer” trait is not merely labeled; its cost is visible when she risks a second viral judgment by welcoming a witness.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The novelist’s paralysis, her “strange practice,” and the final crystallization of her protagonist’s stance all track cleanly through embodied micro-choices (pressing shell to temple, pocketing it, turning homeward). Interior contradiction is vivid: she mistrusts endings yet chases them, and the cost—carrying the sharp-edged hope of memory—is felt in the closing image. No stock interiority or therapy-speak; the flaw (obsessive witnessing) complicates rather than solves. The only minor drag is that the chorus of cameo figures remains gestural; they pressure her but do not individuate, so relationship crucible is absent by scope, not error.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cassian’s interiority is lyrically specific—“fingers stained green,” “heart quickened”—and his micro-choice to turn the crank is the hinge beat. The flaw is that the inherited-mission motive is front-loaded in a reflective block rather than tested under pressure; still, the final weep feels earned because the machine’s success retroactively justifies the obsession. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vera’s interiority is sensorially anchored and contradicted: her threadbare gloves expose fingertips to frost yet move with meditative precision, embodying both vulnerability and mastery. Her motive—mapping arboreal heartbeats—gains credibility through the observatory logbook fragment and the tactile ritual of arranging discarded cores/bark/ice. The earned stasis of sealing the maps inside the oldest tree forecloses her chance to use them elsewhere, a visible cost that scales to 750 words. No head-hop or status dynamic to test; single-POV focus remains tight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s lock-trained fingers and “question that needed answering” give a crisp, idiosyncratic drive; his solitary fixation stays credibly obsessive, and the final choice to share the echo-harvest costs him his outsider status. Interiority is concrete (“pulse quicken,” “muttered, adjusting a hairspring”) rather than diagnostic. The only thinning is that the blight and survivor politics are felt off-page—his isolation is asserted more than tested—so the felt cost is aesthetic rather than visceral. Still, within the lyric design his renunciation of practicality for wonder reads as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fractal-weaver’s interiority is sensorially grounded (“hands seemed to blur into infinite possibility”), but agency is largely receptive—she waits for burdens to arrive and calcify. The decisive shift from “trapped” to “becoming the trap” is declared rather than dramatized with a visible micro-choice, so the cost feels conceptual more than embodied. Still, the kerosene-burner history seeds a credible lineage of endurance, and the final renunciation lands as coherent Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margot’s contradictory impulses—clinging to Roland’s absence while cutting the wood that embodies him—play out in real time at the workbench; the final imperfect bowl is a credible renunciation that costs her the fantasy of perfect preservation. Interiority stays concrete, anchored in tactile wood grain and rain. The only drag is a brief lurch into self-diagnosis (“loss had taught her something else”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fragments while yearning for wholeness—surface in embodied beats (camera wheel spin, hand reaching). The final acceptance is earned because the text has shown her accumulating masks until none fit; the ghost’s hand is the first intact thing she grasps. Cost is legible: she drops the wheel, forfeiting her archive of borrowed selves. Interiority stays concrete, though “therapy-speak” creeps in once (“transformation without direction was just disintegration”).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lena’s curiosity and “desperate optimism” are concrete and embodied; the brass sextant fragment becomes an extension of her tactile drive. The interior contradiction—duty to demolish vs impulse to resurrect—plays out in real choices (tracing stains, drafting the proposal). The final gesture of pocketing the sextant and “already seeing green” crystallizes a credible, cost-burdened shift. Only minor shortfall: supervisor rejection is anticipated rather than dramatized, so the external cost is still hypothetical, muting the final sting.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied early (“her feet whispering,” “satchel grew heavier”); the contradiction between transcription and invention is dramatized through the trembling hand that cannot sketch her own gears. The decisive micro-choice—kneeling to expose the contraband sketchbook—carries visible cost as “petrichor nostalgia” meets “ghost of what she might have become,” earning the later renunciation. Flaw complicity is present: fear of failure is both acknowledged and acted against, satisfying earned stasis without tidy resolution. Voice remains consistent, but the second mention of “excruciatingly gentle” edges toward label-speak, preventing full 9-band clearance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “refined-by-failure compass” and the brass warming in her palm—but the story over-articulates her shift to “understanding voids” with abstract echo (“she understood”). Earned endurance without visible body cost slightly tempers the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s patient decoding and tactile reverence for the rope make her feel like a lone apostate of a lost religion; the moment she re-nests the fulgurite, we see a credo distilled into gesture. No interior clichés, only salt-stung fingers and the decision to archive rather than exhibit—an earned renunciation that costs her the public recognition she secretly craves. The only minor drag: “infinitely patient” is stated once rather than shown through a final test of waiting, but the body-language throughout is so disciplined that the trait still breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. the tender trespass of stealing the carpet thread—surfaces in one sharp gesture and drives the final intimacy. The Duchess’s micro-choices (unmarked palms, the quill grip, the finger squeeze) embody her exile-within-flesh without therapeutic self-labeling. Both women’s flaws complicate the moment: Maren’s voyeuristic craft and the Duchess’s self-haunting collide to earn the shared, costly “slow work of a soul finding its way back.” Only the absence of a second character in the garden prevents a full relationship-as-crucible beat, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cael’s weariness and conviction read through embodied detail (trembling fingers, mud-stained robes). The contradiction he embraces—using mechanization to resurrect wild beauty—gives him a sharp internal fault line that activates in the final moment of hybrid birth. Vashira functions mainly as foil; her mechanical eye recording while her human eye weeps is a tidy split, not a contradictory one, so the relationship crucible stays thin. Still, Cael’s micro-choice to proceed after voicing doubt lands as earned stasis with visible cost: the song that fuses industry and wonder now binds him to the compromised creature.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—arsonist’s heir who rescues from fire—drives every beat; the coin-transfer micro-choice to Elena crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Emotions stay embodied (“old shame rising and settling like clouds”) rather than labeled. The ending renunciation (answering “the only call that mattered”) costs her the radio call-back, visible on-page. Hairline slip: “unyielding compassion” drifts toward diagnostic-speak twice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s “luminous skeptic” persona is vivid—her refusal to announce herself, her habit of mapping “possible truths within natural law,” her silence as tactic. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only soft spot: the climactic release of memories is watched, not agonized; we see no micro-choice that costs her comfort or certainty, so the arc flirts with observer rather than actor. Still, her stance shift from pure doubt to “doubt that acknowledged mystery” is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Keeper’s serene fatalism is credibly alien, but the mother/daughter pair remain sketches—only their sacrifice-reflex is shown. Interiority is poetic-summary (“watched three thousand generations bloom”) rather than scene-pressed contradiction. The brass gear as tactile memory works, yet no micro-choice on the Keeper’s part is dramatized; the help offered feels predetermined. Cost is present (the Keeper’s perennial solitude) but only asserted, not embodied in a beat that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich and character-specific; the carver’s grief is embodied through tactile handling of ribbon and tools. Contradictory impulses surface when she both seeks closure and resists it, though the shift from isolated to collective grief is more declared than dramatized. Final addition of her own poem is earned, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Voice remains coherent and singular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s guilt-driven diligence is viscerally embodied in her aching wrists and blurred vision while engraving; the contradictory impulses—seventeen years of mechanical precision vs. the need to break silence—coexist in scene. Her micro-choice to engrave the pendulum bob rather than speak aloud crystallizes a believable, flaw-rooted avoidance. The rake handle’s gradual lightening and the final walk toward the sea show a credible renunciation with visible cost, earning her earned stasis. Interiority stays concrete, though one moment drifts toward abstract “ethical diligence” label-speak, clipping the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marta’s interior contradiction—chess strategist blithe about death yet rocked by a single loss—lands as a concrete, embodied tension. The micro-choice to drive to the cobalt silo instead of the graveyard she tends crystallizes her new risk stance. Her earned renunciation tomorrow—visiting the seven mis-remembered graves—pays the cost of abandoning her former detachment, forged through the tapestry decoding sequence. Voice stays singular, no head-hop, but limited tactile use of sovereign case keeps her from 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete—her cramping hand, the satchel’s weight—and her micro-choice to write despite uncertainty embodies the “groundedly imaginative” trait. The three-year investment in the quill and the predictive models ground her motivation, and the final endurance (descent with pages) carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the conflict is externalized into the future she writes, so the internal tension reads as resolved rather than simultaneously clashing. Fits short-form scope, but the absence of on-stage relationship pressure keeps it from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s quiet, embodied diligence and the moment she touches the first glowing mote give a credible micro-choice that tilts her stance; the interior contradiction between fatigue and elation is present but stays summary-level, so the final “smile” feels slightly unearned—cost is implied, not dramatized on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s quiet, crematory vocation and her poised shift from blind faith in preservation to deliberate dispersal of “faith itself” register as a credible, embodied arc. The interior contradiction—tending ashes yet clinging to gallery illusion—plays out in micro-choice: lifting the mask, rereading the ash words, then sitting in the stilled rocker. Her flaw (need for curated safety) drives the final renunciation without tidy redemption. Flaw compounds choice; cost is the chair’s silence and her new knowledge that every frame lies.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s “rational rebellion” is embodied only in defensive exposition; we never see him choose against a live offer, so the promised internal contradiction stays off-stage. The brass cog is handled but doesn’t test his resolve—he simply hands it over. Karin’s academic calm is sketched by label (“abrasive calm”) more than by micro-reaction. Still, Marcus’s occupation of the drowned layers and his book-saving past feel idiosyncratic and consistent, keeping the portrait above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mrs. Chen’s interiority is lyrically sketched (“expectantly resigned”) and her vocation supplies motive, but we see no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure; the rehearsal scene is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost of her method is asserted, not embodied. She remains archetype more than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s grief-for-joie-de-vivre is sketched but not embodied; we see no sensory contradiction or micro-choice that hurts during the planting or the first bite. “Hollow” is named, not tasted; the decisive turn to share fruit is inferred rather than dramatized with visible risk—no moment where she might refuse and lose something. Closure earns mild poise yet lacks a felt cost exacted from her own body/relationships. Competent interiority, but the emotional crucible never tightens enough for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s compulsive honesty is dramatized the moment she blurts “This is frustrating,” and her final micro-choice to name the riddle-answer aloud crystallizes her role. Chen’s regret is equally embodied in the cracked voice and the trembling spread of flawed schematics. The two carry sufficient contradictory impulse and visible cost to satisfy the 9- gate, though the shift in Mira’s personal stake is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—her need to “notice” versus her dread of being the only one who sees—are dramatized in the moment she pockets the orris root, not summarized. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial (“smelled of violets and earth”) rather than diagnostic. The final act of leaving without verbal prayer shows earned renunciation; the cost is the solitude she accepts as the price of witness. Micro-choices (handling the root, placing objects, touching the frame) reveal a hierarchy of values: attention > belonging > explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina’s shift from certainty to nuanced acceptance is embodied in the trembling gloved hand and the decision to ascend with the ampoule; the telepathic statue’s centuries of witness give its invitation to complexity credible weight. Interiority stays concrete—‘her mind still reeling from the telepathic cascade’—and the final renunciation costs her the comfort of a simple tragedy. The architect’s backstory is cleanly threaded through present stimuli, never permitted to stall the underwater clock. No secondary characters on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interior contradiction holds.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s “grim optimist” interiority is concrete—she repeatedly calculates escape yet crawls back to risk. Her contradictory fear-of-failure / hunger-for-discovery is shown, not told, and drives the sideways step into void. The dice micro-choice in pocket and roll under pressure crystallizes values. Cost is felt: she wakes with email drafted, path foreclosed, reputation on the line.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s insomnia is credibly rendered through ritual and bodily cost, but her “methodical hope” is asserted more than dramatized; the only micro-choice that visibly enacts it is the decision to keep painting, and that beat is summarized rather than lived moment-by-moment. The internal contradiction between exhaustion and stubborn hope is present, yet never forced into a fork where renunciation feels possible; the result is an arc of accumulation rather than change, acceptable under Accumulative/Textural lens but limiting for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Celeste’s curator identity and reflex to “carry purpose like luggage” give her a coherent through-line; the bread-initial custom dramatizes her need to anchor names before they vanish. Interiority stays concrete—fingers on cold lens, dough under knuckles—but emotional contradiction is only asserted (“rosewater dread”) rather than enacted in-scene. Because no second character shares real-time dialogue, status crucible and micro-choice under opposition are absent; the final thaw is collective, so her personal cost feels diluted. Still, her stance crystallizes credibly: she trades passive curation for active rescue, forfeiting the safety of mere witness.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s monomaniacal tinkerer-heretic is vivid—calloused fingers, clocks that run backward, months alone dismantling a yoyo whose physics insult hers. Interiority stays concrete: “she had long stopped caring which” crystallizes her brinkmanship without label-speak. The final step into self-spun radiance is earned because every micro-choice (reverse-winding gears, mapping 4-D knots) has already bled time and flesh. Cost is visible: the cracked hunger stone and abandoned lighthouse make renunciation tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Margot’s “photographically cursed” trait is vivid label-only until late; the advisor remains a Gothic prop rather than a pressure source. The interior contradiction—terror of breathing yet calm self-analysis—never collides with embodied cost; her micro-choices stall at confession. The clasp’s final beat lands, but the emotional ladder between drowning terror and trophy stride is skipped; we see no degradation under stress. Earned stasis exists, but the price feels intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s vocation as “leeward tide prophet” is vivid and embodied—she strikes trees, feels copper wire thrumming, reads cloud fractals with calloused hands. Interiority stays sensory, never diagnostic: “the sketched resonance…built in her mind” keeps knowledge bounded to her craft. Micro-choice under pressure is strong: the single decisive order “Do it” crystallizes a hierarchy of values—community survival over sailing orthodoxy—and the cost is visible when the orchard tilts and the vortex roars three miles off. The flaw: we never see a private contradiction or flaw that could betray her; competence edges toward immaculate, muting the internal conflict lever.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s quiet obsession with the spiral language is embodied through ink-stained fingers, obsessive measuring, and the decision to risk the Council’s scorn—each micro-choice tightening her stake. The interior contradiction between dread and compulsion is present in every beat, never reduced to labels. The final shift from observer to actor is earned because the story has let us watch her map the crack’s advance and feel the whistle’s grief; the cost is visible when she stands alone on the fracture she alone has measured.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elena’s “rescue truth” drive is concrete and consistent; her micro-choice to photograph the letter rather than steal it shows embodied stakes. The interiority is mostly character-specific, but “heroes could be flawed and foundations could be both false and necessary” drifts toward thesis-speak. Hawthorne’s guardian role is credibly conflicted, yet his final relief is asserted rather than dramatized. The cost—public exposure of myth—is felt, but Elena’s personal price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—professional duty versus private archival obsession—are dramatized in the tactile act of sealing memories into cracks; the final vow to research the letters shows a micro-choice that forecloses an easier life with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through patina, ink, water pressure; no stock labels. The “stoically sensitive” trait is embodied when he trembles yet reseals the box, accepting further absorption of others’ grief. What keeps the score sub-9 is that the internal stakes plateau after the box discovery; we don’t feel the next tightening that would force a costlier mistake or renunciation before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s calm indexer persona is vivid and consistent; her “tranquilly perceptive” stance under pressure is dramatized through micro-choices (cross-referencing by lamplight, re-stamping the sheet). Interior contradiction is light—no real tension between caution and obsession—but embodied emotion (“pulse quickened”) and tactile handling of stamp/tools keep her alive. The arc is a quiet crystallization rather than a change, satisfying Earned Stasis yet missing a sharper cost or flaw-driven mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei’s grief is palpable in her body—trembling hands, silk polish, crease-by-crease folding—and her refusal to stop at 853 remaining cranes is a credible, costly endurance. The interior contradiction between scientific craft and desperate faith is dramatized, not declared. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; the story keeps its focus on a single, fully realized will. The final renunciation (she simply returns to the next gem) lands as Earned Stasis with the cost of perpetual, infinite labour visible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the frost-rimed glass, the bleak exhilaration she names—yet the “unfiltered awakening” is asserted more than dramatized. The micro-choice to adjust thrusters is present but lightweight; we don’t feel a fork in her path, only a continuation of the hunt. Still, the contradiction between scientific detachment and grief-driven obsession is embodied convincingly. Earned stasis is hinted but not fully paid in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s isolation and “perpetually surprised” brows read as a lived tic; her reflex drone-launch shows embodied competence. The pilgrim is sketched only as reverent courier, so relationship crucible is thin. Closure choice—“She would bring it home”—is earned by her prior pattern of outsider-scanning, cost felt in the solitary night ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s guilt is palpable and embodied—her trembling fingers, nightly panic, nightly shore rituals—giving us a living contradiction between professional pride and self-loathing. The choice to dismantle her empire is telegraphed early, but the climactic micro-choice to let Elias walk away without self-defense crystallizes a visible cost. Interior monologue avoids therapy-speak; instead, driftwood and watch hand act as extensions of her body. The only drag is Elias’s off-stage arrival, which lessens the relationship-as-crucible pressure in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Katrin’s calm, ritualized bearing and tactile attention to the brass pull give her a sharp, idiosyncratic presence; her interiority is concretely anchored (turning the pull under moonlight) and her risk—standing alone between armies—carries visible cost. The “recycle mistakes into wisdom” motive is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice, so the internal contradiction feels slightly under-cooked. Still, her authority and fatigue land as lived-in, and the final solitude earns a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s paralysis and cautious re-entry feel lived-in; the compass-weight in her lap and refusal to use it embody shame without label-speak. Her decision to paddle is credibly incremental—first a weather observation, then a quiet “I’ll use everything”—so the turn feels discovered, not declared. Amy’s grief mirrors hers, but Amy is sketched only enough to trigger Marina’s shift; secondary-character pressure is thin. Still, Marina’s contradictory impulses (fear of recurrence vs. need to redeem navigation) coexist in-scene, and the final “navigating… through them” crystallizes a visible cost: she forecloses permanent land-bound safety.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—urgency to know vs terror of who he was—are alive in every beat; the moment he fingers the ball’s stitches while asking “What did I do?” shows embodied guilt without label-speak. His micro-choice to set the ball down and step back is a credible renunciation that costs him the comfort of certainty. The Interpreter’s jaded wonder is sketched in two efficient strokes: silver hair + eyes that still “fascinate,” giving her status as chorus without stealing focus. No therapy-speak or stock epiphany; the flaws stay messy and unbalanced.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her fear and yearning are embodied in the spice-crush and the fur that “resembled constellations.” Yet the brother’s ghost remains a gentle mirror, not a pressure source; his dialogue explains stakes rather than forcing her to test or betray them. The final choice is earned, but the cost is asserted more than felt; we see her surrender humanity, but the immediate consequence is reunion, not loss. Still, the contradiction between whisperer and beast is dramatized in her own skin, satisfying the 9+ threshold for contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cartomancer’s interior contradiction—yearning to atone yet still stealing time even on the pilgrimage—remains concrete and embodied. Her final micro-choice to trace her hand three times beside the infant’s print crystallizes a value hierarchy with felt cost: the cloud-beauty she surrenders versus the living skin she finally touches. The tablecloth object anchors generational guilt without slipping into abstracts. Flaw compounds choice: her compulsive busy-ness is the very sin she must abandon, making the renunciation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei’s emotional mass-mod acts as a lived barometer, anchoring her joy in physical drift; her obsession with crystallized grief is credibly obsessive, but Akio’s pacifist stance stays mostly ornamental and costs her nothing concrete in their one exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—giving away millions yet still enacting philanthropy through micro-coincidences—are dramatized in every beat; her decision to release the last lightning bugs and keep walking is the earned culmination of that pattern. The embodied warmth of the sand and the spiral of the insect create a non-cliché emotional vocabulary. Micro-choice under pressure (pointing the lost surveyor north) shows value hierarchy with visible cost—she trades her final resources for directional charity. Internal degradation is subtle: destitution has sharpened, not softened, her compulsion to give, and the final self-definition (“orchestrator of small miracles”) is the logical, costly outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s “vigilant lock sentinel” persona is vividly sketched in the dark-fort beats, but her internal contradiction—the loyal guardian who has already decided to betray—remains asserted rather than dramatized in scene; we are told she’s been waiting for the blackout rather than shown a micro-choice that proves it. Commander Voss steps in as a second on-page voice, yet their shared complicity is exchanged in tidy agreement, not tested under pressure, so the relationship crucible never really fires. The final smile is a serviceable Earned Stasis, but the cost feels light because the story never lets us see what she’s truly risking (job, life, friends). Interiority is concrete (“her fingers trailing along familiar walls”) yet slips into diagnostic summary (“she’d been waiting for it”) that blunts the edge of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Korin’s precognitive curse, eel-herding vocation, and grief for her grandmother braid into one urgent, embodied drive. Every rock she places is a micro-choice that dents the world; her trembling hand at stone 15 makes the cost visceral. The final renunciation—letting friction stay gone—lands as earned stasis because the pattern of stones and eels has foreclosed reversal. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—angry yet still, silenced yet screaming—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (winding the timer, folding the poem). The renunciation of public voice for clandestine archive is earned; cost is felt when she seals the envelope destined for the timetable. Flaw is active: she risks capture with every drop. Voice stays idiosyncratic, never drifts into diagnostic jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Adelaine’s mechanical-arm calculations and “diplomatically fierce” tone are vividly particular; the shift from duel to joint decoding is earned by her visible ingenuity and Harwick’s gradual curiosity. Interior contradiction is light—she never doubts her method—so the arc is more partnership than personal wrench. The cost is social: she concedes future combat in exchange for intellectual alliance, a credible trade.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s shifting selves are shown through distinct micro-choices—reciting doggerel, shelving in silence, planting with September’s “sharp-edged” grin—each tied to a visible cost (memory loss, emotional whiplash). The friendship with Kai dramatizes a believable crucible: shared Tuesdays that keep both alive post-incarceration. Only the “molting” mechanism is asserted more than demonstrated; we’re told August wept but not shown why that self mattered. Still, the ending renunciation—planting futures she won’t recognize—pays the price of identity flux on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pianist’s interior contradiction—ritual grief versus the covert insurgency of splicing film—drives every beat; the twenty-year wound is embodied in the cracked keys and the nightly winding of the dead clock. Her micro-choices (threading the projector, hiding frames of her wedding inside celluloid) are precise, character-specific, and escalate stakes without tidy epiphany. The final smile and “song about arrival” crystallize Earned Stasis: she forecloses perpetual mourning with visible cost—the ticking clock now alive behind her, compasses re-anchored to love rather than north. Hairline slip: “strategically creative” is named once in narration; the dramatized splice-work already proves it, so the label feels redundant (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kima’s interiority is concrete (“seed…weight like a tiny sun”) and her contradictory impulses—oath-bound skepticism vs. ache to believe—are present in scene. The final leap is foreshadowed by the dream fragments, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Yet the sister functions more as exposition mouthpiece than crucible, and the “reality checker” credential never alters tactics; the job title stays ornamental. Emotional progression is steady but avoids genuine irrationality—no self-deception or hypocrisy surfaces under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s need to “read” the lace and to tend memory instead of recovering the past is embodied in her micro-choices (opening the box, pruning). Yet the grandmother remains an off-stage cipher; her only contradictory impulse is relayed through Takeo’s calm exposition, so the interior conflict is filtered, not dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is credible and costs her the fantasy of reunion, but the emotional groundwork is second-hand, keeping the score just under the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Helena’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her analytical rigor battling grief—and her micro-choices (brushing wing dust, documenting scales) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The trait “preprocesses reality” isn’t diagnostic label-speak but manifests in spreadsheets and cataloguing, grounding her emotional arc in behavior. Her transformation from detached observer to humbled witness feels earned, not epiphanic. The final decision to rebuild emerges organically from accumulated evidence, not imposed insight.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete and artist-specific—her perception of frost as “nature’s glass” reveals her worldview without exposition. Her steady hands under threat embody her core trait (“steadily adaptive”) and align with her moral stance against Galloway’s brittle violence. The final choice to bind him and return to creation—not vengeance—feels earned through prior causality and carries the cost of ongoing legal entanglement. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through craft metaphors that never slip into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her silence isn’t absence but a roaring void translated through physical sensation and thermal response. Her micro-choices (striking the fork, pressing against panels) reveal a hierarchy of values: expression over speech, presence over recovery. Professor Chen functions as a crucible without overshadowing her agency; their dynamic pressures her toward reconfiguration, not cure. The final renunciation of voice-as-music for body-as-instrument is earned through consistent, tactile causality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcel’s motivation—rooted in professional identity and empathetic duty—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly. His internal contradiction (weary resignation vs. compelled action) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation (“The dead have hired me”) is earned by prior causality with visible cost: closing his parlor, risking his life. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through concrete action and perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in intergenerational exile and quiet resistance—is consistent, embodied, and deepens under pressure. Her internal conflict between anonymity and connection manifests in concrete choices (midnight runs → public declaration), not abstraction. The young woman’s response validates Mara’s arc without resolving it neatly, preserving moral ambiguity. Final renunciation of secrecy carries visible cost: exposure to sanctions risk for communal continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mei’s motivation—searching for “where unused love is stored”—is rooted in a visceral past-life memory and embodied through micro-choices (carrying the camera obscura, producing Kwan Yin’s tear). Her interior conflict between grief and spiritual curiosity manifests as contradictory impulses: seeking resolution yet fearing re-traumatization. The pilgrim’s presence pressures her into vulnerability, culminating in an earned renunciation (leaving the tear behind) that forecloses her quest with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany emerges from breath, image, and action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s retrocognitive condition is embodied through trembling hands, tactile interaction with photographs, and micro-choices like pressing the fragment fully despite fear—revealing a hierarchy of values (understanding over stability). Her motivation—to map time’s texture—is consistent, specific, and intensifies to compel irreversible action. The final renunciation (returning the fragment, accepting recursive existence) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she surrenders linear selfhood. No diagnostic label-speak; even “retrocognitively trapped” is filtered through clinical memory, not interior monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her strategic patience, embodied in the meticulous key-sorting under duress, reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her motivation (preserving biodiversity as resistance) intensifies credibly under pressure, driving every micro-choice without over-articulation. The final act of planting seeds—not fleeing or fighting—earns an Earned Stasis that forecloses personal safety for collective resilience. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (“chains singing their quiet song”) and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in maternal loss and synesthetic perception—is vividly embodied and drives every action. Her internal conflict (to preserve or release the sound of broken trust) manifests as simultaneous impulses, not alternating summaries. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: her realization that memory’s weight lies in how we carry absence, not in perfect recall. Tears freezing on her cheeks and trembling fingers render emotion tactile, avoiding diagnostic label-speak even at peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, luminous disbelief, and compulsive theft reveal layered contradictions without diagnostic label-speak. Her final renunciation (“I’m not the thief. I’m the subject”) emerges credibly from prior causality, with the cost of abandoning her old identity legible in her relinquishing the jar. Celeste functions as a crucible, not a cipher, applying precise pressure through coded lilies and moonbeam revelations. The micro-choice to walk away empty-handed crystallizes Maya’s hierarchy of values: creation over possession.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his glassblowing metaphors mirror his emotional fractures without diagnostic label-speak. His micro-choices (keeping the bookmark, narrating to ghosts, finally tucking it away) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The contradiction between his need for understanding and his sister’s demand for immediacy drives credible inertia and eventual change. His final decision feels earned through accumulated pressure, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her phobias clash with her resolve, her trauma with her empathy. Her micro-choices (entering the library despite panic, photographing evidence rather than fleeing) reveal a hierarchy of values forged in betrayal. Reeves’ voice crackles with desperation, not caricature, and their single phone exchange layers moral ambiguity without safety-hedging. The final decision to expose both mother and consortium feels earned through prior causality and carries relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The oracle’s obsession with endings is embodied in her actions and voice, not just stated; her micro-choices—interrupting the commander, drawing silence-maps—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The commander’s restrained reactions ground his authority and grief without melodrama. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; emotion emerges through salt-heavy robes, flaking gold leaf, muffled steps. Their dynamic crystallizes under pressure without head-hopping or exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    J-7’s interiority is concrete and consistent: his obsession with the origin of thought drives micro-choices across loops, culminating in a violin performance that embodies his epiphany. His “remarkably composed” demeanor isn’t a label but a costly trait—contrasted against fragmented janitors—and enables his endurance. Emotion is embodied through servos humming, frost-sweeping rhythms, and diagnostic readouts made audible. The final realization feels earned, not diagnostic, because it emerges from repeated tactile engagement, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her breath catching, trembling hand, and pulse quickening reveal emotion without diagnostic labels. Dmitri’s vulnerability (“I don’t know how to tell her”) and Samir’s blunt honesty create credible interpersonal pressure. The final choice—to draw hands instead of words—is earned by months of accumulated silence and misread signals, with the cost being prolonged isolation now relinquished. Both characters act from consistent flaws: fear of rejection and aversion to eavesdropping, which directly shape their arc.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vine dresser’s pragmatic resilience and Marcus’s wounded curiosity are rendered through embodied contradiction—her polishing ritual versus his stunned passivity—and her backstory is revealed through present action, not exposition. Her micro-choices (adjusting marbles three times, selecting specific sprigs) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in reclamation, not revenge. The final renunciation—Marcus standing among the marbles while she walks into the maze—is earned by her prior endurance and his dawning understanding. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile detail (“hands moved with the certainty of roots finding water”).

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and particular—“obliging sky mechanic” reframed as quiet expertise, not servility. Their motivation (proving sideways time) emerges through calibrated action, not exposition, and culminates in a Charged Poise ending where vindication carries the cost of years spent in obscurity. Venn’s presence sharpens Kael’s arc without stealing focus; their dynamic reveals status subtly (“fixing what others broke”). No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats—their awe remains embodied in gasps and leaning closer.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marta’s motivation—driven by an unnamed inspiration and loyalty to the ghost’s silenced truth—is consistent, embodied, and deepens under pressure. Her micro-choices (wading through water, photographing evidence, playing Pachelbel) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, memory over silence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are conveyed through tactile detail (“water lapping at the third rung,” “resin dust scattered in deliberate patterns”). The final whisper (“I heard you”) crystallizes her arc without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is crystalline yet contradictory—her fever-dulled awareness gives way to sharp guilt and technical rigor, embodied in her heavy limbs and precise keystrokes. Her flaw (overconfidence in fault-tolerance as infallibility) directly caused Reeves’ death and drives her revisionist urgency. Chen’s quiet presence acts as crucible without overshadowing; their shared grief fuels collaborative repair. The final micro-choice—to rewrite the oracle’s core logic—is earned by her fever-revelation and carries the weight of irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his religious skepticism, obsession with patterns, and emotional restraint shape his micro-choices (e.g., photographing beads, turning valves). His motivation intensifies credibly across nights of radio listening, culminating in a quiet endurance that forecloses direct confrontation but accepts the burden of witness. The flaw: his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he moves steadily from curiosity to comprehension without visceral struggle. Still, his final act—documenting rather than resolving—feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception—her shift from preservation to witnessing emerges via tactile, sensory choices (e.g., gripping reality loosely, feeling the library breathe). Her motivation evolves organically from past error (“holding too tightly crushed what needed to breathe”) to present renunciation, culminating in Earned Stasis with visible cost: her own calcification into the archive. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse in her simultaneous reverence for and surrender to decay. The origami swan discovery triggers a micro-choice (to burrow) that aligns perfectly with her reconfigured values.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her doubt, tenderness, and professional restraint are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., holding back tears, matching Thomas’s humming without dominating). Thomas’s mutism isn’t a label but a lived condition shown through posture and incremental vocal emergence. Their contradictory impulses—Mara’s fear of inadequacy vs. her commitment to witness; Thomas’s desire to speak vs. anxiety—are active simultaneously. The final whisper feels earned by prior causality, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miren’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her tactile sensitivity, historical empathy, and quiet devotion feel specific, not archetypal. Her micro-choice to mount the tapestry beside other witness-objects crystallizes her values with visible cost: she shoulders the burden of memory in a world that has abandoned it. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action (“pressed her hand here”) and sensory perception. However, Catherine exists only as textual echo, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s motivation—transposing spycraft into grace—is embodied in her micro-choices: embedding the microdot in a UV-sealed fortune, selecting recipients by their habits, and enduring isolation to protect her method. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion surfaces through tactile precision (“folded it carefully,” “pen moving with practiced precision”) and moral clarity rooted in her father’s failure. The final reflection on truth being “already in your hands” crystallizes her arc without epiphany, revealing a lifetime of quiet resistance as both burden and gift.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Father Calloway’s motivation—to dismantle possession by interrogating assumptions about motion and stillness—is consistent, embodied through his loop pedal and cobalt markings, and culminates in a renunciation of struggle that feels earned. His internal contradiction (action vs. surrender) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. Marcus’s flickering awareness and shudder register embodied response without over-articulation. The final choice (“you were never separate enough to struggle”) emerges from prior causality with conceptual cost: relinquishing the fight itself.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her exhaustion, longing, and epiphany arise from concrete sensory cues (nautilus shell, mirrored horizon) rather than diagnostic labels. Her shift from hollow fortune-writing to “conducting symphonies” feels earned through micro-choices: climbing before dawn, pressing the shell to glass, transcribing present wonder. The grandfather’s legacy functions as emotional scaffolding without over-explaining her transformation. Final renunciation of prediction for translation carries conceptual cost, crystallizing her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—gravity as both curse and prison, fragmented selves across timelines—and her final choice to retrace the harder paths feels earned through consistent micro-decisions. Her emotional arc avoids therapy-speak, instead grounding self-confrontation in tactile memory (oak tree, mother’s grave, carnival kiss). The contradiction between freedom from physics and imprisonment by fear drives every beat. No unmotivated epiphanies; the cost of wholeness (loss of infinite maybes) is felt in her knees and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Oskar’s interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—his deafness, numbness, and craft are rendered through tactile memory and micro-choices (e.g., keeping the needle, reversing recordings). His motivation intensifies credibly from isolation to shared discovery, culminating in a quiet certainty that feels earned. Marie’s parallel struggle mirrors his without flattening her into a foil. The final renunciation of despair carries visible emotional cost: decades of silence revalued as creative ground.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marianne’s interiority is precise and embodied—her meteorological rigor shapes perception, micro-choices (e.g., unscrewing the tube with “practiced fingers”), and moral stance. Her curiosity isn’t abstract but drives action under pressure. The renunciation of solitude for collective record-keeping carries visible cost. Flaws like social detachment are consistent and consequential, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, profession, and longing intertwine without diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (not opening the vial for years, then finally uncorking it) reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. Contradictory impulses—preservation versus release, memory versus oblivion—act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation isn’t tidy; it’s a reconfiguration of loss made visible, earned by every withheld breath before.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile observation and poetic perception, avoiding diagnostic labels. His motivation—to witness transformation in the wake of cosmic upheaval—is consistent and deepened by his reverence for the rope as narrative artifact. The encounter with Sarah feels earned because his method (reading objects) directly enables it. Minor deduction: his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle, though “passionate certainty” grounds it in action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation—rooted in familial tradition, acoustic perception, and grief for a silenced world—is embodied through precise micro-choices: wading into floodwater, placing the bowl upside-down, selecting unfinished pieces. Her internal contradiction (longing for completion vs. honoring incompleteness) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. Emotions are rendered through ash-dusted tears and tactile violin weight, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of closure itself is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of living in unresolved beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—between professional detachment and dawning moral unease—is rendered through embodied perception (“static electricity dance across her skin”) and micro-choices (remaking the blotter). Her shift from counterfeit forgiveness to “an acknowledgment of the wish to forgive” feels earned, with visible cost in lost certainty. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile, sensory channels. Final renunciation of pure artifice forecloses her old method with quiet but legible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marianne’s shrewdness is grounded in specific professional habits and evolves credibly into a broader moral awareness. Her micro-choices—returning the envelope, initiating documentation—reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from transactional to communal. Chen’s whimsical attentiveness feels character-particular without veering into caricature. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution, showing layered gratitude and quiet transformation rather than epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—longing for belonging without knowing how to “graft” herself—is embodied in her craft and silence, culminating in the marsh sculpture that externalizes her internal conflict. Her micro-choices (standing outside the arbor, speaking up about weaving patterns) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The final act of creation is earned by prior causality: her expertise, isolation, and gradual engagement during the search. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile detail (“frozen starlight,” “tears streaming”) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s motivation—finding the birthplace of echoes—is deeply personal and rooted in her mentor’s dying words, driving every micro-choice. Her internal conflict between scientific observation and mystical intervention manifests in embodied tension (e.g., pendant warmth, temporal scars). The final renunciation—releasing the echo—carries visible cost: temporal wounds that “fade like bruises.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is filtered through professional perception (“crystallizing melody,” “silk made of memory”).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her grief manifests through tactile rituals (planting, positioning glass eyes) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (to find vs. to accept ambiguity) act simultaneously in the climax, culminating in Earned Stasis that forecloses resolution but affirms her new axiom: “some systems remained unsolvable while still being true.” The warmth of the glass eyes and the seed-like optimism breaking “through stone” show change without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her yearning for mattering crystallizes through embodied memory (the smell of tape triggering childhood recollection) and micro-choices (multiple trips to rescue reels). Her “kindly methodical” trait isn’t labeled but enacted, and her final renunciation of visibility-as-body in favor of presence-as-preservation feels earned. The graduate student’s tears provide external validation that resonates without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s internal contradiction—between scientific control and organic surrender—is embodied in micro-choices (leaving moss, delaying pruning) that carry visible cost. Her emotional progression avoids diagnostic labels; instead, feelings emerge through tactile interaction with leaves, rain, and soil. The final release of the linden leaf crystallizes her transformation without overstatement. Motivation remains consistent from inheritance to epiphany, rooted in lived failure rather than abstract insight.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    The painter’s interiority is vividly embodied—her insomnia, artistic drive, and skepticism feel lived-in, not abstract. Her contradictory impulses (rational doubt vs. intuitive pull) act simultaneously in key moments, especially when she offers the brooch to Marcus. The final choice—to keep following the rain trails—is earned by prior behavior (weeks of obsessive painting) and culminates in a renunciation of isolation for communion, with clear emotional cost. Marcus functions effectively as secondary pressure without overshadowing her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her synesthetic perception, pride in precision, and devastating realization are rendered through concrete sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels. Her final choice to relinquish omniscience feels earned by the pilgrim’s confrontation and the cave’s rebellion. The transformation from oracle to student carries visible cost: the loss of her identity, purpose, and control. No emotional summarizing; every shift is dramatized through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her reactive vision both enables her archival work and isolates her, culminating in a micro-choice (offering the valve) that reconfigures her role from witness to bridge. Thomas’s brief but precise presence reveals mutual recognition without exposition. The emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels; hope is “something more complicated,” felt through clenched chest and staggered observation. Her final renunciation of burden for connection is earned by seventeen years of quiet attention.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her analytical precision and artistic intuition coexist in tension, revealed through micro-choices like sketching cracks instead of fleeing. Her motivation (“I dare”) emerges from seven years of suppressed curiosity, not exposition. The conductor’s warning sharpens her flaw: rationality masking emotional avoidance. Final validation isn’t epiphany but earned action—drawing maps that integrate truth and route.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s interiority is richly embodied—her vertigo, tears, and tactile interaction with the tile convey emotional and cognitive shifts without diagnostic labels. Her “sympathetic skepticism” manifests in micro-choices: transcribing journals despite doubt, pressing the tile to stone when disoriented. The inherited trait “courageously kind” retroactively gains causal weight, justifying her openness to entangled memory. Final transcription is a credible endurance that forecloses pure empiricism with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cassius and Naia’s motivations are deeply rooted in their immortal/mortal tension, with contradictory impulses—boredom vs. connection, escape vs. loyalty—acting simultaneously in scene. Naia’s choice to use the fragment is earned through layered resentment and agency, not passive despair. Cassius’s final turn toward re-tearing dimensions reveals a credible, costly endurance (Earned Stasis inverted into obsession). Their dialogue crackles with history, and micro-choices (her stepping closer, his palm on the wall) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “mathematics of honesty” isn’t abstract but enacted through micro-choices (e.g., documenting cons, choosing silence until the breach). Vincent’s collapse feels earned because his flaw (compulsive deception) directly causes his downfall, and his tears carry credible emotional weight without therapy-speak. Their dynamic crystallizes under pressure: Mara’s moral clarity forces a reconfiguration of their relationship with visible cost (his livelihood, her loyalty). The final line—“calculating the odds of his resurrection”—perfectly fuses her character logic with thematic hope.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stationer’s motivation—to collect the textures of time—is embodied through precise, tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., kneeling to touch roots, selecting frequencies). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge via sensory contradiction (“rigid yet yielding” memory). The final renunciation—recording falsely even in truth’s presence—is earned by her consistent scholarly devotion to invented histories. Flaws are integrated: her earnestness borders on obsession, making her endurance credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she drifts yet collects, resists bureaucracy yet seeks reintegration. Her micro-choices (touching objects, listening to stories) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on memory over official identity. The harbormaster encounter crystallizes her motivation without over-explaining. Final renunciation (“I’m going to fix the paperwork”) carries visible cost: she must re-enter the system that erased her.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s internal conflict—between empirical skepticism and emotional longing—is embodied with precision, especially in her trembling hand on the bow and her sharp past retorts replayed through resonance. Her micro-choices (playing the cello, pressing the shell to her ear) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. The final renunciation—not finishing the cello but carrying forward its meaning—carries visible cost: she abandons her lifelong epistemic rigidity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—between empathy for newcomers and terror of assimilation—is embodied in her micro-choices (e.g., teaching sanitized tourists the graffiti code). Her orderly intuition isn’t just stated; it drives her tactical shift from absorber to organizer. The foundation stone chip anchors her trauma without therapy-speak. Final renunciation (“constant refusal to be anything but what they were”) is earned through prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Chen’s interiority is concrete and particular—his trembling hands, scientific composure battling melancholy, and micro-choice to place the sand grain among moonflowers reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His “purposefully curious” trait drives action, not just observation. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene; the shift from documentation to testimony feels earned but borders on tidy. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars his portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her blindness sharpens other senses, and her micro-choices (e.g., using water refraction to diagnose) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in repair as redemption. Her calm competence never veers into perfection; the hairline lens fracture is found through struggle, not omniscience. Voss functions effectively as secondary pressure without stealing focus. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of sight itself—redefining perception as a form of vision with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in editorial precision and mythic curiosity—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her dry wit, tactile observation (“traced the condensation… not quite touching”), and micro-choices (keeping gear ready, sending the falcon) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: years of isolation, obsession mistaken for futility. Petrov functions as both foil and pressure valve, his dialogue sharpening her resolve without diluting her agency. The final renunciation isn’t of goal but of secrecy—she chooses proper heralding over haste, a credible endurance that forecloses anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell tuner remains enigmatic yet compelling, her motivation rooted in a consistent, resonant worldview. Her actions—walking, tuning, listening—are extensions of her identity, not exposition. Secondary characters (baker, Sarah, Matthias) apply light but functional pressure, revealing her through reaction rather than interiority. However, her lack of internal contradiction or visible struggle prevents full 9+ status; she is catalyst, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—desire for the vial versus duty to save Chen—are embodied and sustained through tactile hesitation and decisive action. Chen’s obsession feels earned, not archetypal, rooted in a lifetime of scholarly longing. Both characters act within consistent limits: Mara resists the vial’s pull not through superhuman will but by anchoring herself in immediate crisis. The final renunciation carries visible cost: locking away proof of preserved consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Matthias’s motivation—redeeming his father’s legacy through active choice—is rooted in embodied contradiction: shame versus faith, skepticism versus hope. His micro-choices (pushing the door, fitting the lattice, stepping into light) reveal a hierarchy of values with escalating cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile detail (“lattice grow warm,” “sound moved differently”). The final renunciation of the outside world is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his trembling voice, the bead’s hum in his bones—and his final choice (“I release you”) emerges credibly from ancestral burden and empathetic understanding. Eleanora’s contradictory impulses (love vs. ambition) manifest in her “lovingly venomous” confession and translucent flickering. The micro-choice to kneel and bury the bead carries visible cost: ending centuries of vigil but also relinquishing a family mystery. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and forgiveness unfold through sensory detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    The weaver’s motivation—transforming ruin into reverence through repetition—is embodied in every stitch and sleepwalk, revealing a hierarchy of values (devotion over escape) with visible cost: her departure, fingers missing red dust. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion manifests through tactile ritual (“indigo cord,” “violet silk”). Her blind first night and final circuit form a credible arc of earned endurance. The contradiction between monastic precedent and her haunting optimism fuels agency without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s motivation—restoring fractured faith through ancestral reconnection—is embodied in tactile choices (carrying the sundial, clearing stones) and evolves without epiphanic leaps. Her internal conflict between exile and belonging manifests as contradictory impulses: hesitation versus purposeful action, doubt versus reverence. The villagers’ warmly curious presence applies subtle social pressure that shapes her endurance. Final renunciation of transient identity for rooted restoration carries visible cost: six weeks lost, a life abroad abandoned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.3)
    Iris’s contradictory impulses—between erasure and reclamation, fear and love—are embodied in trembling hands, coded chalk, and the weight of a real name. Her micro-choices (cross-referencing codes, hesitating at the slot) reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using tactile, profession-specific perception (“meaning in the margins”) to ground emotional truth. The final act of mailing is earned by six months of preparation and fifteen years of absence.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mirelle’s interiority is vividly embodied—her gnarled fingers, trembling performance, and needlework-as-intelligence reveal a lifetime of coded resistance. Her motivation (listening to “unheard stories”) directly fuels high-stakes choices under pressure, especially her final sprint to Tomas. The contradiction between her performative frailty and acute perception operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. Her renunciation of direct action for documentation is earned and carries palpable cost: she has no allies, only hope that “someone understand[s].”

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Meera and the client are rendered with precise interiority—grief, regret, and "fierce tenderness" feel embodied, not diagnostic. The woman’s micro-choice to almost call her sister is credibly dramatized, and her final shift from trapped anguish to charged poise carries visible emotional cost. Meera’s cryptic wisdom avoids archetype through specific action (using the shard, guiding condensation writing). Both characters remain flawed yet human, with no safety-hedging or over-articulated self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maricel’s interiority is precise, embodied, and layered—her translator’s instinct to “witness every moment” clashes with the anesthetic’s erosion of control. Her micro-choice to cling to the coral fragment despite fading consciousness reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, clarity over oblivion. The child Imelda functions as off-page pressure but catalyzes Maricel’s final resolve without violating single-POV constraints. Flaws like her compulsive need for meaning are consistent and costly, not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her paralysis, longing, and epiphany arise from specific sensory triggers (the fragment, the fog, the memory of sun).

The final decision to paint light-as-joy feels earned, not diagnostic. No therapy-speak; her realization emerges from tactile engagement, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “methodically playful” restoration practice reveals a deep tension between reverence and curiosity. Her micro-choices (pocketing the nickel, tapping the wall, choosing not to report the discovery) are consistent with her established motives and carry clear opportunity costs. The dream logic feels character-specific, not generic mysticism. Her final act of cleaning rather than covering the fresco crystallizes a renunciation of institutional certainty in favor of open-ended inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias and Mara’s motivations are rooted in consistent traits—his roguish intellect, her tactical gardening—and their choices under pressure (e.g., switching meeting sites, using undeciphered scripts) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Interiority is concrete (“hands still dirty from the message patterns”), and emotions are embodied rather than labeled. The “candidly cryptic” trait manifests in Elias’s dialogue without becoming diagnostic or performative. However, secondary characters remain silhouettes, which is acceptable given scope, but slightly limits relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s motivation—transforming suffering into luminous art through insomnia—is embodied with striking specificity and internal contradiction. Her micro-choices (tucking verses, weaving diesel fumes into metaphor) reveal a hierarchy of values: beauty over rest, witness over withdrawal. The final renunciation isn’t of pain but of resolution itself—“peace with the ache”—an Earned Stasis forged over centuries. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in nacre, petals, and off-key wind.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Miren’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her micro-choice to preserve the cracked chime over repairing it reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in personal history. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. memory) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The emotional cost of “foxglove regret” is specific, tactile, and tied to irreplaceable loss. Her motivation intensifies organically from routine caretaking to active archiving of the unspeakable.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “carefully reckless” penmanship, the ache at Marcus’s graying temples—and her contradictory impulses (fear vs. honesty, loyalty vs. truth) drive every micro-choice. Her flaw (cowardice masked as loyalty) directly causes the rupture and fuels the confession, making her final vow feel earned. The relationship crucible works: their shared history pressures Mira’s action, and Marcus’s wounded quiet evolves into fragile trust. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (“hand cramped,” “chest ache”) and Varesh-script stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tremors, warmth of the chain, and grandfather’s moral calculus ground her choices in lived contradiction. Her motivation intensifies organically from forensic curiosity to ethical engineering, with micro-choices (leaving the letter unsealed, sketching under pressure) revealing a hierarchy that values both people and history. The final redesign emerges credibly from her dual identity as machinist and inheritor of wisdom. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains tactile and conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fear of honesty, her grief for lost selves, and her tactile relationship with objects like the meteorite chip feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (deflecting Marcus, choosing to stay and catalog) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, emotion emerges through action (“balancing a shoebox against her hip,” “handwriting forming new paper trails”). Her final decision to remain and document is earned by prior causality and carries the visible cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her tactile reading of oak grain, the tension between child and seeker, and her micro-choice to write “PRESNT” all reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. Her contradictory impulses (to find vs. to understand; to cross vs. to stand) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Thomas serves as effective pressure without diluting focus, and their dialogue sharpens stakes without exposition. The final renunciation—choosing thresholds over mazes—is earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    Senna’s motivation—seeking “the rhythm of belonging”—is embodied through micro-choices (tracking spires, suiting up) and internal contradiction (analytical astrologer drawn to ineffable communion). Her transformation from observer to participant feels earned, with clear cost: abandoning surface life for irreversible immersion. Mara’s presence deepens Senna’s stakes without overshadowing her agency. The final decision to enter the water crystallizes her arc without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile interaction with sea-foam, crater glass, and iridescent walls reveals a character defined by sensory translation of emotional residue. Her motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to revelation, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses infinite paths with conceptual cost. The “cheerful gloom” reflects genuine internal contradiction, not diagnostic label-speak. Her final choice—to carry the weight of knowing unmade moments are pruned—is earned through prior causality and micro-choices (e.g., uncorking vials despite tide’s approach).

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, control mechanisms, and contradictions manifest through micro-choices (e.g., chess as performance, mapping randomness). Her flaw (over-engineering serendipity) directly causes her defeat, making the reversal earned. Rebecca’s challenge exposes Mara’s blind spot with surgical precision: “terrible at protecting yourself.” The final openness feels credible because it arises from a specific, dramatized crack in her armor, not abstract epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaleth’s motivation—dancing forbidden memory into her body—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal conflict (obedience vs. remembrance) manifests through simultaneous contradictory impulses: reverence for tradition and defiance of the ban. The final renunciation (choosing exile as belonging) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: permanent solitude and transformation into a living archive. Her grandmother’s whispered wisdom grounds her choices without sentimentality or diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Martin’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his scarred hands, the childhood stone, his disillusionment—all filtered through a glazier’s perceptual lens. His epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak and arises organically from watching ripples interact with reflected architecture. The micro-choice to throw stones twice deepens his realization without overstatement. Final renunciation of hollow work carries quiet cost: he returns to routine, but seeing has changed.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his refusal of grafts, his fixation on the girl’s trust, and his tactile handling of the box reveal layered contradictions without therapy-speak. His final decision to leave firefighting emerges organically from prior causality: the Riverside trauma, estrangement from his daughter, and his self-imposed penance. The cost—abandoning his identity as protector—is legible in the closing image of him descending with the cracked box. No unmotivated epiphanies; every micro-choice aligns with his scarred worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her logical dreamer identity manifests through micro-choices (arranging shells, interpreting the gauge) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her motivation—reconciling catastrophic divergence through equations for hope—is rooted in grief yet never sentimental. The final renunciation (“The equation doesn't need to prevent divergence. It needs to measure its beauty”) is earned by five years of trial balloons and micro-adjustments studied from her grandmother’s crash data. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied via tide-surges, trembling needles, and synchronized patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her perception of sound as memory, her trembling hands, the weight of the satchel—all reveal a character whose sensitivity is both gift and burden.

The final choice—to continue mapping, now as participant rather than observer—is earned through prior causality and carries emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions feel lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vesper’s interiority is vividly rendered through her doubled heartbeat and perceptual calm, grounding her motivation in embodied contradiction. Her micro-choices—painting faster as the bell tolls, embedding lullabies into brushstrokes—reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost: time, secrecy, emotional exposure. The backstory of her twin is economically woven and directly shapes present action without flattening pressure. However, the final renunciation lacks a concrete, dramatized sacrifice beyond abstract “gift”—cost is felt but not fully legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her ritualistic method arises from trauma, not theory, and her “operatively gentle” voice reveals a hierarchy of values forged in loss. Her micro-choices (interrupting the general, retrieving the clipboard during collapses) are precise, costly, and consistent. The final renunciation (“Long enough to matter”) is earned through prior causality and embodies flawed endurance rather than tidy victory. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in cracked voices and weeping, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his ruthless pragmatism clashes with buried sentimentality rooted in childhood bird-song recordings and his father’s journal. His final act of releasing the egg feels earned, not sentimental, because it emerges from embodied memory and a micro-choice under pressure (lifting the egg skyward before shattering it). The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; grief is “dense as grief,” not explained. His renunciation forecloses his empire’s logic with visible cost: rain erases his map, farmers reclaim land, and he stands exposed.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Celestine’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as a silenced courtesan, and her internal conflict—between obedience and rebellion—is embodied through precise physicality (“fingers trembling not from cold but from purpose”) and micro-choices (untangling threads with care). Her transformation feels earned, culminating in a credible renunciation of conformity with visible cost: the loss of safety, status, and silence. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, grounding emotion in action rather than abstraction. However, the absence of on-page interaction with others slightly limits relational crucible depth, keeping this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his silk cravat, the driftwood stick, his tactile handling of puppets—and his moral reckoning avoids diagnostic label-speak. His contradictory impulses (desire to provoke vs. yearning for ethical integrity) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The collaborator’s off-page accusation catalyzes credible self-doubt that reshapes his choices, and his final renunciation of caricature feels earned through concrete micro-choices with visible cost: abandoning a successful but hollow method.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief for lost migrations, her academic rejection, and her esoteric realism coalesce into micro-choices (knotting bamboo, placing the moth wing) that feel inevitable yet costly. Her contradictions—building to honor impermanence, witnessing while refusing monumentality—are active in scene, not summarized.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail (dust-fine scales, cool air on antennae).

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, self-reproach, and fragile hope manifest through tactile memory and precise physical action (“her caster’s fingers knowing instinctively”). Contradictory impulses coexist: she forgives herself yet still trembles; she seeks preservation but works with impermanent materials. Her micro-choices (weaving specific words into the rope, feeding braids into molten bronze) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The final act—hanging bells to speak lost names—is earned by her prior collapse and renewal, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Foresight Hindsight Only’s interiority is vividly embodied—her perception of time as a “continuous landscape” emerges from concrete sensory experience, not abstraction. Her motivation (“to discover why some paths choose their walkers”) drives micro-choices (pressing seals, entering the bunker) that reveal her hierarchy of values: understanding over safety. The final act—adding her dream to the archive—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: surrendering linear time. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional contradiction pulses in lines like “drowning in chlorophyll” amid epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The astronomer’s frugality, intellectual devotion, and emotional restraint are consistently embodied in her patched trousers, secondhand tools, and tactile engagement with the tile.

The final act of weeping while packing the tablets reveals a rare vulnerability earned by prior restraint, showing interior contradiction without diagnostic self-awareness. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her epiphany arises solely from on-page deciphering.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira and Kale are vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—Kale’s fury warring with inherited grief, Mira’s pacifism tempered by strategic patience.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aria’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, breath-syncing with the fog, and tactile work with glass paste reveal contradiction between control and vulnerability. Her motivation (to retrieve her brother) intensifies credibly through micro-choices: arranging sextant shards, applying silver paste despite fear. The brother’s translucent return shows earned endurance with visible cost: she risks dissolving boundaries to restore one. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marta’s interiority is richly embodied—her shame, regret, and yearning pulse through tactile details (the ribbon, the bag, the grinding stone). Her flawed compromise with the corporation feels tragically human, not schematic. Lena’s feistiness manifests in dialogue and action (“You promised me the old methods”), not just labels. Their reconciliation emerges from shared craft, not sentimentality, with visible cost: lost time, trust, workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, pacing, bath-time epiphanies—and her contradictions (curator of order confronting nonlinear chaos) drive every micro-choice. Her realization in the tub feels earned, not diagnostic, and her final acceptance carries the cost of lifelong isolation. The blank shell becomes a mirror of her own role in the lineage, deepening motivation beyond mere inheritance. No head-hopping or label-speak; emotion phosphoresces precisely because it’s filtered through tactile, professional perception.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marin’s motivation as an arcane linguist is tightly interwoven with her actions—her ability to “hear” the bookstore’s symphony and interpret proto-linguistic symbols drives every key decision. Her internal conflict between scholarly pursuit and urgent rescue is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., using torn paper as breadcrumbs, choosing words “between languages”). The time traveler’s transformation shows credible endurance with cost, but Marin’s own arc lacks a visible personal sacrifice beyond risk—her competence slightly overshadows vulnerability. Still, her flaws feel authentic, not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hand, shifting memories, and sensory disorientation reveal a psyche under duress without diagnostic labels. Her final choice to “pull the thread that hurt least” feels earned through accumulated micro-decisions (e.g., trusting the card, descending into the funhouse). However, Soren’s presence blurs motivation: is he memory, hallucination, or chimera echo? This ambiguity slightly weakens causal clarity in her climactic act, though it serves theme.

    Maren’s warmly methodical temperament is embodied in precise actions (“fingers traced the first braid,” “talked quietly to herself”) and drives every choice without diagnostic self-awareness. Her motivation—to translate confusion into clarity—is consistent, credible, and culminates in a Charged Poise ending where she accepts her role as narrative weaver. The story avoids epiphanies, instead showing earned understanding through tactile engagement with the rope. No secondary characters dilute focus; interior contradiction manifests as disciplined persistence against temporal instability.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is rooted in communal suffering and personal expertise, with micro-choices (e.g., reading ice cracks, choosing silence over escape) revealing a hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using embodied perception (“teeth ache,” “sound that lived in the bones”). The final act—carrying the stone upward—is earned by his accumulated knowledge and desperation. No secondary characters dilute focus, preserving single-POV intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Esme’s retrocognitive ability drives concrete choices—handling the prism, interpreting star charts—and her internal contradiction (rejecting accidents while seeking meaning) fuels every action. Her micro-choices (e.g., descending at dawn with shards as “a promise”) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: isolation, physical risk, emotional burden. The final renunciation isn’t of hope but of passive waiting; she actively proves meaning through labor. No diagnostic label-speak mars her interiority—epiphanies bloom from tactile history, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elden’s preemptive nostalgia is embodied, not labeled—felt in her palm against the crystal and her breath catching at the recursive shadow. Her motivation to “sculpt identity from experience” drives every micro-choice, culminating in her voluntary absorption. The final act is earned by prior interior logic and carries visible cost: she ceases to be archivist and becomes archive. No diagnostic self-awareness; emotion arises through tactile perception and charged silence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his shame, muscle memory, and hesitant hope coexist without tidy resolution. His micro-choices (accepting the knot, resuming the chant) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by failure. The woman’s burns and “serious playfulness” create immediate status tension that deepens their dynamic. Final renunciation of his old identity is earned through tactile re-engagement, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira and Chen’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—Mira’s anger masks grief, Chen’s observational detachment hides his own pain. Their micro-choices (Mira reaching for the cicada, Chen kneeling by the pool) reveal shifting values under pressure. The “warmly observant” trait drives Chen’s indirect communication, which both alienates and ultimately connects. Flaws are consistent and costly: his tangential approach delayed emotional presence, a wound now acknowledged with visible regret.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s claustrophobia and sky-bound yearning manifest in embodied, contradictory impulses—she both flees and clings to her mother’s legacy. Her micro-choices (kicking off the trellis, clutching the doll) reveal a hierarchy of values: breath over safety, curated quiet over inherited silence. The final renunciation of bunkers is earned by two years of collecting silences as atmospheric counterweights to confinement. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in porcelain against sternum, cloudvines sprouting “confused.”

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s grief is embodied through white knuckles, rigid posture, and the haunting specificity of hospital monitor sounds—avoiding therapy-speak while revealing internal contradiction between wanting silence and being haunted by noise. Marco’s “fluidly logical certainty” emerges not as exposition but through calibrated actions: adjusting speed, course, and speech to match atmospheric and emotional conditions. Their micro-choices (Elena finally speaking, touching the vial; Marco reducing motor speed) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. The final whispered “possibility” feels earned, not epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaida’s motivation is rooted in decades of scholarly pursuit, not treasure-hunting greed, and her interiority—“wisely adventurous certainty”—feels earned. Her micro-choices (running back to the throne room, pressing palms to glass) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over power. The ruby flake’s dissolution into embodied knowledge avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead showing transformation through tactile sensation (“warm as blood”). Final renunciation of sitting the throne in favor of remembering is credible and costly under the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars, ash-covered vigil, and precise language (“burned carefully”) reveal a history of calculated self-preservation without diagnostic label-speak. The girl’s wrist scars function as both wound and language, grounding emotional stakes in physical detail. Their micro-choices (touching the ring, accepting Mara’s hand) carry visible cost and reconfigure relational dynamics. Both characters avoid archetype through idiosyncratic perception and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trauma from Marcel’s scheme directly informs her cautious yet defiant agency. Her “virtuously mischievous” trait manifests in concrete micro-choices: documenting evidence while smiling, mapping exits while seeming trapped.

No diagnostic label-speak; pressure crystallizes into wisdom without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassian’s motivation—penance through truth—is embodied in micro-choices (handling the crank, winding the gramophone) and layered with contradiction: he destroyed his family yet seeks deeper culpability. His emotional state avoids diagnostic labels; instead, we feel his burden through tactile detail (“cold water” of understanding). The final decision to carry the cylinder to the Kateri council is earned by prior causality and carries visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    The knight’s internal contradiction—between compelled duty and terror of manipulation—is embodied in precise physical reactions (teeth aching, shivering bliss) and micro-choices (removing armor piece by piece). His motivation roots in a witnessed metaphysical truth (the strings), not cowardice, making his final re-engagement with the oath feel earned. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; his epiphany emerges through motion, not exposition. His transformation from withdrawn observer to active dancer carries visible cost: shedding armor = shedding denial.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her broken heart coexists with professional rigor, embodied in her tactile handling of files and the button. Her micro-choices (cross-referencing, contacting the historical society) reveal a hierarchy of values: bearing witness over personal closure. The backstory of Thomas is economically anchored to present stimuli (dust, abandonment) and tilts her stance without dominating it. Her final renunciation—accepting she can’t reunite father and son but ensuring their story lives—is earned and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s quiet competence and internal contradiction—between invisibility as survival and the burden of remembrance—are embodied in micro-choices (photographing puddles, vanishing into a vault) that feel earned and specific. Her emotional state is rendered through tactile detail (“brass worn smooth,” “water lapping against stone”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of reappearing at the checkpoint crystallizes her endurance with visible cost: deeper isolation. No head-hopping or knowledge violations; flaw (underestimation) directly enables both survival and mission.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—rooted in familial legacy, coded prophecy, and musical inheritance—is rendered with emotional specificity and embodied contradiction. His trembling fingers, the weight of the letter, and his deliberate use of “negative space” reveal a character whose internal conflict (skepticism vs. inherited belief) drives every action. The final renunciation isn’t denial but embrace-as-silencing, an earned endurance that forecloses confrontation with ruin through quiet mastery. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in saxophone keys, dewdrops, and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Miren’s transformation from orderly sorter to intuitive keeper is credibly rooted in her temperament and deepens through embodied choices—charting leaf patterns, touching the moonstone speck—that align with her evolving relationship to memory and prophecy. Her internal contradiction (precision vs. surrender to mystery) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of mere sorting for active monument-building forecloses her old identity with visible cost: she can no longer explain herself to others. No diagnostic label-speak mars her epiphanies; insight emerges through tactile, sensory engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “uncertainly certain” touch, his trust in fracture over precision—and his final choice to preserve breaks rather than restore function feels earned. His micro-choices (cleaning with vinegar-rainwater, following the needle) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth in imperfection over mechanical order.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)

Her motivation—to make absence visible through alchemical naming—is consistent, deeply personal, and intensifies under pressure. The magistrate’s hollow-eyed grief serves as a crucible that sharpens her resolve without diluting her agency. Final renunciation (“I had redeemed nothing, perhaps…”) is earned and carries the cost of unresolved personal grief.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “modest fearlessness” isn’t declared but shown through calm presence amid spectral trauma.

The micro-choice to laugh at the cake crystallizes her hierarchy of values with emotional cost: tears on her cheeks, the tooth flaring hot. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and healing emerge through tactile, specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sera’s interiority is vividly embodied—her proprioceptive enhancements manifest as both sensory overload and mathematical perception, creating simultaneous contradictory impulses: the drive to quantify pain versus the yearning for peace. Her final choice to “plant” is earned through micro-decisions (unclipping the mask, sitting in the clearing) that foreclose her past identity with tangible cost. The old man functions not as a foil but as a mirror, his presence pressuring her stance without dominating it. No diagnostic label-speak; trauma lives in muscle memory, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)

    Marcus’s motivation—rooted in his daughter’s question and his professional attunement to hidden things—is consistent, embodied, and drives every micro-choice. His calm engagement with the ghost feels earned, not performative, and his final promise carries emotional weight without sentimentality. The ghost’s silent urgency contrasts effectively with his methodical demeanor, deepening interiority through action rather than exposition. However, Celeste remains more symbol than character, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s internal conflict—between safety through repetition and the terror of change—is embodied in precise, character-specific ways: her trained blindness to tilting floors, her visceral recoil at rustling pages. The operator functions not as a foil but as a catalyst whose cryptic dialogue forces Marina’s buried self to surface. Her final choice to reach for the biography is earned by micro-choices (not stopping the press, uncorking the whisper) that reveal her hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through glass chiming, floor lurching, fingertips on pages.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kasimir’s interiority is vividly embodied—his revolutionary past, grief, and evolving understanding of loss are rendered through tactile gestures (hovering fingers, clutching a journal) and specific memories (covering mirrors). His motivation shifts organically from obsolescence to purpose via the shard’s revelation, and his final renunciation of destructive revolution in favor of “emotional archaeology” feels earned. The cost—his failed legacy—is woven into every reflection without therapy-speak. A hairline slip: the transition from personal failure to civilizational insight leans slightly on assertion rather than dramatized micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aldric’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his profession, tools, and moral compass shape his choices under pressure. His micro-decisions (e.g., choosing not to remove the stone fragment) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he moves from diagnosis to resolution with admirable but untroubled certainty. This near-flawless competence slightly softens emotional complexity required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in her belief that “scent held memory” and her inherited psychometric gift—compels every choice with escalating stakes. Her internal contradiction (scientific collector vs. seeker of the irreducibly strange) manifests physically: trembling hands, deliberate boot removal, final dive. The cost is legible in her renunciation of surface life; her transformation feels earned through consistent traits and micro-choices. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments—emotion is embodied in vial-clinking, compass warmth, water’s “recognition.”

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation—scaffolding complexity with simplicity—is embodied in her sculptural practice and deepened through her encounter with the lantern slide. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are rendered through tactile perception (“slick with spray,” “turbine-hum reverie”) and micro-choices (ignoring the GPS, pocketing the slide). The final decision to build transparent, layered work emerges credibly from prior causality, with visible cost: she abandons navigational certainty for ancestral intuition. Contradictory impulses—reduction vs. revelation—act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her stalled artistry, inherited obsession, and emotional recalibration feel specific and lived-in.

The grandmother’s postcard note crystallizes generational continuity without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Malik’s interiority is concrete and morally grounded, with micro-choices—like kneeling to witness—that reveal his hierarchy of values under unbearable pressure.

    Madame Verity and Marcus are vividly individualized through embodied contradiction: her muteness versus urgent prophecy, his childlike curiosity versus archivist destiny. Their micro-choices—her beckoning, his acceptance of the vial—reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost.

The final handover of the ledger earns Marcus’s transformation through two decades of devotion, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)

Her internal conflict between fear and necessity manifests as simultaneous silk/sandpaper sensations, avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her polishing ritual, sensory engagement with the vial, and quiet resistance to Thomas reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her motivation stems from lived inheritance, not abstraction, and her final choice (to whisper, not shout) forecloses Thomas’s method with visible relational cost.

His micro-choices—kneeling, opening the key, pinning the Edelweiss—reveal a hierarchy of values (duty over safety, memory over closure) with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Martin’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—“empirically intuitive in geography yet perpetually lost in his own life”—and his micro-choices (following ants, removing the chip) reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. The final decision to re-engage with life feels earned through embodied hesitation and tactile interaction with the matrix chip. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory detail (narcotic roses, luminous fungus). His flaw—emotional isolation—is confronted not resolved, yielding Earned Stasis with visible opportunity cost.

    Solène’s motivation—to capture the “density of presence”—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (measuring amber, etching formulae) and deepened by her fraught history with the Academy.

Mira functions as both emotional anchor and crucible, her whispered question catalyzing Solène’s confession without flattening either character into archetype. The final micro-choice—pressing the sphere into Mira’s palm—reveals a hierarchy of values: testimony over utility, intimacy over institutional validation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her jealousy of past selves, diagnostic self-awareness (“chronologically confused”), and micro-choices (writing dreams in birch ink) reveal layered contradiction without therapy-speak.

No unmotivated choices; every gesture aligns with her fractured yet determined psyche.

Her final renunciation—accepting that time is negotiated, not measured—is earned through escalating physical and conceptual stakes. The razor key’s bite literalizes cost, and her micro-choices (counting backward, turning the key) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over institutional order.

    Mara’s internal conflict—between her professional instinct to fortify boundaries and the emotional need to release—is rendered with embodied specificity (e.g., “mapped every relationship as a network topology”). Her final renunciation (“delete his number”) is earned through the laser button’s physical metaphor and Chen’s catalytic presence. The micro-choice to press/release the spring enacts her shift without diagnostic self-awareness. Flawed yet competent, she avoids safety-hedging: her spatial gift both enables insight and imprisons her.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—loving yet resenting her father, seeking meaning while preaching chaos—is embodied in precise, character-specific ways: tracing symbols on fogged glass, clutching a hospital bracelet, narrowing vision then widening it. Her final choice to visit him feels earned, not epiphanic, with the cost of enduring unresolved pain made visible through the clover metaphor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge via action (e.g., pocketing the notebook) and perception (symbols “breathing” through mica). The micro-choice to reinterpret subway scrawls as questions directly enables her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sarah’s interiority is vividly embodied—her touch of the glass disc, her breath catching—and her micro-choices under pressure (breaking protocol to play the disc, urging the caller to contact his son) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: her job, her role in “cultivated estrangement.” Her flaw (empathy overriding duty) drives an inevitable, earned renunciation that forecloses her prior path. The elderly caller’s voice distinction is subtle but sufficient for this length, and his grief feels specific, not archetypal.

    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “desperately jocular bark,” the moon rock as emotional proxy, and her logistical competence all cohere into a specific, flawed psyche. The arrival of Emil and others forces micro-choices (keeping the stone, allowing entry) that reveal her hierarchy of values: autonomy over connection, until reciprocity reconfigures that calculus. Her final shift isn’t epiphanic but earned through the collective act of gathering, with visible cost in relinquishing perpetual motion. Secondary characters remain distinct in voice and pressure, never collapsing into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)

Her interior conflict between academic precision and moral urgency manifests in micro-choices (e.g., photographing the connection, not just observing it). The final renunciation—accepting criminality to keep a promise—is earned through layered backstory that alters present action (Kenji’s grandmother’s whisper guides her). No diagnostic label-speak; grief and purpose are shown through tactile memory (“ghost of pressure” on her wrist).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theo and Marquez are rendered with profound interiority, their contradictory impulses—resistance versus surrender to entanglement—active throughout the scene. Their shared trauma, grief, and identity bleed into micro-choices (drumming, perching, interlacing hands) that carry visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)

    Maren’s motivation—recovering the “texture of connection”—is embodied in precise actions (adjusting the lamp, curating breath-sounds) and rooted in her trauma-turned-tool (the crystalline vertebrae). Her internal contradiction (initial hatred of her bells vs. later harnessing them) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final choice—to share rather than study intimacy—is earned by her lived arc and carries conceptual cost: she abandons pure research for communal vulnerability. The volunteer’s presence tests and validates her conviction without reducing either character to archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—self-harm as epistemology, obsession as justice—are embodied with visceral specificity and never abstracted into therapy-speak.

    Marianne’s interior contradiction—skeptic yet forgiver—is embodied in micro-choices (“wanted to yearn… but her skeptic’s training held”) and culminates in a final decision that forecloses certainty with palpable cost. Her “shrewdly innocent” trait isn’t labeled abstractly but shown through her misreading of the substitute corpse and delayed recognition of truth. The reunion avoids sentimentality by grounding emotion in tactile detail (the warm tooth, shaking hands). Her flaw—trusting false certainty—directly caused her daughter’s prolonged absence, making the stakes morally weighted and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s grief, agency, and transformation are rendered with precise interiority and embodied contradiction—especially in her tactile ritual of polishing glass as a proxy for healing. Her micro-choices (selecting abrasives, positioning shards) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. The final act of preparing the grotto for children shows renunciation of isolation without sentimentality. Her flaws—fixation, silence—are never hedged, and Elena lives in subtext, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tension, tears, and micro-choices (not fleeing, accepting the notebook) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

The protagonist’s endurance forecloses easier paths with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassian’s motivation—restoring his grandmother’s sacred songs through engineering—is rooted in specific, embodied history and intensifies credibly under pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through tactile detail (“fingers stained green,” “wept as he turned the cranks”). The final choice—to distribute fruit and songs—earns its cost: years of isolation, societal dismissal, and the burden of being the sole rememberer. His flaws (obsession, secrecy) complicate but don’t obstruct his arc, making his endurance feel both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vera’s motivation is rooted in a precise, embodied alchemy of patience and preservation; her internal conflict—between urgency and stillness—is dramatized through micro-choices like gloveless fingertips and deliberate placement of decayed matter. Her flaws (isolation, obsessive ritual) compound without safety-hedging, and the final act of sealing maps in the tree trunk enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: she forgoes personal use of the starlight to serve the orchard’s memory. The line “her body demonstrating what her words never could” crystallizes a character whose interiority is inseparable from action.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s motivation—storing wonder as a survival resource—is consistent, embodied in his obsessive reconstruction work, and culminates in a credible renunciation of immediate communal concerns for long-term spiritual resilience. His internal contradiction (pragmatic locksmith vs. poetic archivist) acts simultaneously in scene, especially when he mutters about storing wonder “in the cellar of reason.” The cost is felt: social isolation, skepticism from survivors, and time diverted from conventional survival tasks. However, secondary characters remain functional rather than fully individuated, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fractal weaver’s interiority is vividly embodied—her recursive gestures, sensory perception of silence as “shingled hush,” and emotional filtering through whalebone reverie reveal a psyche under pressure without diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation (“to collect the weights of different burdens”) is consistent and deepens through micro-choices: orienting each burden, placing the burner, sitting still only after comprehension arrives. The final renunciation—leaving crystals behind—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she becomes the container, not the escapee. Her flaws (obsessive pattern-seeking) directly drive the trap and its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, resolve, and ambivalence manifest through tactile engagement with the wood, the rain, the kettle.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, with emotions embodied through tactile observation (water stains, brass sextant) rather than diagnostic labels.

The final act of drafting a counter-proposal despite likely rejection shows credible endurance with felt cost. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; all insight arises from on-page stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—between fear of failure and yearning to create—is embodied in trembling hands, secret sketches, and the weight of the satchel. Her micro-choices (unpacking the sketchbook instead of the resignation letter, whispering to the crystals) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution, layering shame, nostalgia, and fragile courage without diagnostic self-awareness. Final action—returning to build clocks—is earned by prior causality and carries clear opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—her obsession with Viktor Haleš stems from years of failed quests, making her intuitive leap credible. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied through tactile responses (e.g., the sundial’s warmth). The final renunciation—accepting that truth lies in absence—is earned by prior failures. However, her competence borders on uncanny; a sharper flaw or hesitation under pressure would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—preserving ancient knowledge—is consistent, embodied in tactile actions (tracing knots, re-sealing rope), and deepened by her emotional investment in seeds and weavers. Her patience isn’t passive; it’s active reverence that drives every micro-choice. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering insight through sensory engagement (“fingers tracing,” “breath forming small clouds”). The final act of re-sealing the rope enacts Earned Stasis: she honors the past without extracting it, with visible cost in time, solitude, and snow-laden shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren and the Duchess embody interior contradiction with precision: the Duchess’s “projection” as avoidance, Maren’s quiet agency in offering permission to stop explaining. Their micro-choices—Maren entering without knocking, producing the thread; the Duchess weeping then squeezing her hand—reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost. Emotion is embodied (“shoulders shaking,” “unmarked palms”) without therapy-speak. The final renunciation—letting absence be—is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prince Cael’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is embodied through his mud-stained robes, trembling hands, and willingness to accept hybridity. His internal contradiction (longing for purity while embracing machinery) manifests physically and ethically, especially in his acceptance of the phoenix’s mechanical components. Vashira’s dual eye and arm mirror this duality, deepening relational pressure without overshadowing Cael’s arc. The final choice—to proceed despite imperfection—is earned by prior struggle and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—skepticism warring with wonder—is embodied in her micro-choices (e.g., pressing panels “with sidereal patience”) and never resolves into tidy certainty. Her “realistically imaginative mind” grounds her epiphany in plausible speculation (“quantum principles,” “footprints in snow”), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final shift—doubt acknowledging mystery without surrender—is earned through tactile engagement with the box, not abstract revelation. Her luminous skepticism evolves credibly, with visible cost: she relinquishes pure rationality but gains a richer, questioning light.

The rake handle and brass bob become extensions of her psyche, grounding moral struggle in physical labor.

Her internal contradiction (diligent copyist vs. revolutionary archivist) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final transcription is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she foregoes passive reception for active dissemination, risking exposure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail (“fingers ached,” “held her breath”).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
