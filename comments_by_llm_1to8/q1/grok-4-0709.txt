    Elena's transformation from clinical detachment to acceptance is earned through concrete observation of the butterfly dust's decay patterns, with her final choice to clear the decay "not with frustration, but acceptance" showing genuine cost. The internal contradiction between her need for control and the flood's chaos drives authentic tension, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("kindled humility," "strip needless drama").

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to discover purpose through reconstructing her shattered life is clear and consistent, with embodied details like tears welling and breath visible in crisp air. The character shows genuine struggle between survival trauma and artistic renewal, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("she knew she must retrace"). The final choice to transform family darkness into luminous art carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore music is clear and consistent, driving her through the conservatory to the tuning fork discovery. Her "silently expressive" trait manifests effectively through "furrowed brows and subtle smiles" and later intensity. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical—terror to grief to resolve—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the final triumph lacks the messier emotional complexity that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's weariness and inadvertent stubbornness manifest through embodied details like "bent like a drowned willow" and his refusal to leave until souls find peace. His motivation crystallizes from exhaustion to resolve when the lens arrives, driving meaningful choices. The character arc from passive undertaker to active guide lands with visible cost in his final exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving him to unite generations through anonymous acts, culminating in his public declaration. The internal consistency holds but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—his "gently persistent" nature never faces genuine internal opposition. The final renunciation of anonymity carries visible cost (vulnerability of exposure) but the transformation feels slightly predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in the past life memory, driving her quest for unused love. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—her healing happens through abstract breathing rather than dramatized struggle with visible cost. The final transformation feels unearned as we don't see her grapple with self-forgiveness before achieving it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of time itself" drives consistent choices through the halo fragment discovery and retrocognitive trap. The internal conflict between his obsession and panic when trapped creates genuine tension, with his final smile accepting the cost of knowledge. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("quaking heart," "tremor in his soul") that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as protector of the seed vault is clear and consistent, driving his patient decoding under pressure. His embodied struggle with chains while maintaining strategic focus shows contradiction in scene. The final satisfaction watching invaders retreat demonstrates earned character endurance, though internal complexity could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to find "the sound of trust breaking" drives credible internal conflict through synesthetic perception and experimental self-modification. The final moment of capturing the sound provides emotional release through "a battered marvel of healing forged from loss," though the transformation feels slightly abstract rather than embodied in specific changed behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation as a portrait thief believing in soul fragments is clear and drives concrete choices. Her internal shift from theft to creation at closure is earned through the moonbeam revelation, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("luminous disbelief" repeated). The final renunciation of thievery carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's theatrical self-narration ("To shape the molten heart!") effectively externalizes his coping mechanism, and his motivation crystallizes through concrete action. The shift from frozen grief to "thoughtfully alive" spirit earns its arc through the bookmark embedding ritual, though some interiority slides toward abstraction ("the gravity of loss danced with fleeting joy").

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's phobias create genuine internal conflict and drive meaningful choices, particularly in the climax where he uses his fears as tactical advantages. However, the transformation from Jax to Elias feels rushed, and Mara's motivations remain underdeveloped despite her crucial antagonist role. The final choice to embrace vulnerability lands with some cost, but the emotional progression compresses too quickly for full credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's motivation to map silence is consistent and deepens through concrete ritual actions. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("mild obsession" reads as label rather than embodied compulsion), and the character lacks contradictory impulses that would create deeper complexity. The final act of closing the booklet shows agency through renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eko's motivation to find where thoughts originate drives consistent choices through the violin discovery and playing, with clear internal stakes. The character remains remarkably composed as specified, though the emotional progression from mechanical precision to "now whole" lacks intermediate embodied states that would elevate the arc. The amalgamation of looped memories creates genuine internal conflict but resolves too smoothly into enlightenment without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "thaw mistrust with transparency" drives concrete action through the projector lens ritual, and his internal contradiction between isolation and connection plays out in scene. The final choice to reveal his own vulnerability lands with visible cost. However, the woman visitor remains more symbolic vessel than fully realized character, and some emotional transitions feel compressed rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to prove gardens transcend luck is clear and consistent, driving his elaborate deception. The contradiction between his low luck score and his patient expertise creates genuine tension. However, the final victory lacks embodied emotional cost—we see the garden bloom but don't feel Elias's internal price for the deception beyond surface triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to prove lateral time is concrete and drives action, while Jax functions as an obliging helper with mechanical warmth. The final choice to reverse the lever shows agency under pressure with visible cost (temporal eddy threat). However, character complexity remains limited—both fulfill functional roles without internal contradiction or embodied stress degradation during the crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to unravel Vincenzo's ghost code is clear and drives every action, with his "heart attuned to the in-between spaces" establishing a specific perceptual signature. The transformation from "lately inspired" to "transformed" tracks causally through his deliberate discord-playing that reveals the water-born code. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ethereal pull," "gaps between life and echo") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to disrupt sacred silence with intentional discord shows genuine character-specific agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover her brother's death is clear but arrives late (paragraph 9). The fever recovery provides embodied vulnerability, yet her internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses required for higher bands—she moves linearly from illness to revelation without wrestling competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like examining the beaded valve wheel and his physical responses to the ghosts. The internal conflict between skepticism and emerging belief creates genuine tension. However, the transformation from skeptic to believer feels slightly rushed in the final beats, and the connection between his father's disappearance and his own "swallowed truth" could be more precisely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation "to witness change without judgment" drives consistent characterization, and his shimmering form that "gripped reality loosely" creates a coherent supernatural observer. The final choice to return and repeat the ritual shows earned endurance with visible cost ("crumbling peace of his existence"). However, internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in scene, and no contradictory impulses act simultaneously during observation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation through grief (lost daughter) creates genuine emotional grounding, and Finn's transformation shows earned change through the eclipse moment. However, the characterization relies on telling rather than embodied contradiction—Elara's "softly adaptive" nature and Finn's skepticism are declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to collect wall-heard stories is consistently embodied through concrete actions like probing ashes and reading with "sensitively perceptive" attention. The character's peculiar traits manifest in specific behaviors rather than labels. However, the final hope-stirring lacks sufficient embodied cost—we don't see what Elias sacrifices or risks in this moment of potential restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—embedding microdots into fortune cookies to expose island secrets—with his spy past providing consistent internal logic. The "accidentally prophetic" trait manifests believably through subconscious pattern recognition. Minor deduction for the convenience of everyone accepting his orchestration without meaningful resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" drives concrete ritual actions with embodied tension ("walls themselves breathed in shallow gasps"). His method of loop-layering and strategic silence deployment shows character-specific tactics. The final renunciation of sound to defeat the entity demonstrates earned agency, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's chronological homesickness drives authentic internal conflict through embodied details like "pulling him backward like an unrelenting tide" and the physical mapping of memories onto the nautilus shell. The final choice to conduct unheard symphonies emerges causally from his established gift for cryptic writing and temporal affliction, with visible cost in his exhaustion and the ache that "eased, replaced by a forward pull."

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" drives her procedural generation of timelines, with each iteration revealing deeper costs (betrayal, isolation, paranoia). The final touch-down represents earned change through confronting her origin fear. However, the rapid timeline cycling lacks embodied emotional specificity, relying on abstract labels ("rot beneath," "paranoia") rather than concrete contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is embodied through concrete action (experimenting with the broken phonograph) and his final shared release with Mira shows earned change. The piece loses points for some diagnostic language ("emotional numbness that no vibration could pierce") and lacks sharp internal contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to preserve integrity through solitude is consistent and embodied through concrete actions—his meticulous recording, lateral thinking, and ultimate choice to remain unmoved. The internal conflict between curiosity and isolation plays out through micro-choices, though the emotional cost of his final renunciation could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's aromatic caution creates genuine tension through embodied response ("tears welled," "sobs shaking his frame"), and his motivation to understand scent-triggered tears drives concrete action. The internal conflict between avoiding and confronting grief manifests physically, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("fearing the flood of grief it might unleash").

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of time itself" drives concrete actions through the grotto scene, and his ethically playful nature manifests in his final choice to "pattern a new escape." However, the internal conflict between embracing the beings' "eternal now" versus "human chronology" remains more declared than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The violinist's motivation to find beauty in the unfinished is consistently embodied through concrete actions - carrying the bowl, building the fire, performing the ritual. The final choice to "embrace the unfinished" and free the echo shows clear agency with visible cost (the chronic hush breaks). Internal consistency holds throughout, though the character remains somewhat archetypal rather than deeply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" drives concrete choices throughout, particularly in the transformation sequence where she subsumes half-truths into wholeness. The internal contradiction between her past as a dealer of deceptions and her evolution toward authenticity creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels slightly predetermined, lacking the messy irrationality that would elevate to the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to uplift silent contributors drives his decision to personally return the envelope, creating clear causality. The internal consistency holds, though emotional complexity remains somewhat surface-level with phrases like "cautious exuberance" repeated without deeper embodiment. The final choice to fund an exhibit demonstrates earned change with visible cost (financial commitment), though the rapid friendship formation strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirah's motivation to graft onto community is clear and drives choices throughout, but interiority relies on abstract phrases like "luminescent ache of isolation deep in her bones" rather than embodied contradiction. The final dedication choice lands with visible community integration, though the emotional progression from isolation to belonging follows predictable stages without compelling internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find the echo-source is clear and drives concrete actions, with her time-sculpting ability creating genuine stakes. The character makes decisive choices under pressure (diving into the submerged chamber, using borrowed time as a key), though internal contradiction could be more visceral in-scene rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "understand the mathematics of emotion" drives consistent action through the ritual, with embodied grief in clutching the glass eyes. The final vision provides earned closure through accumulated detail rather than dramatic reversal. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("ambiguous loss," "buried optimism") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to help the lost is clear and consistent, driving his emergence from hiding. The transformation from physical librarian to spectral guardian carries emotional weight, though the mechanism of his existence (ghost? metaphor?) remains ambiguous. His final choice to become visible costs him his cherished invisibility, a meaningful sacrifice earned through the tape fragment's sense memory.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to study plant behaviors is clear and drives her transformation, with embodied details like "hands, calloused from years of tending soil." The metamorphosis creates genuine internal conflict between panic and scientific curiosity, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Her "circuitously sincere" trait manifests well through indirect admissions like "like how the old oak bends without breaking, maybe I'm just learning to sway too."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's insomnia and artistic drive are well-embodied through physical details ("eyes bloodshot," "fingers trembling"), and his motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" manifests in concrete action. The shift from isolation to connection feels earned through the brooch discovery. However, Mira's appearance and instant recognition of the brooch strains credibility, and her voice lacks distinction from Elias's register.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation earned through the cave's inhabitation, but interiority relies on abstract states ("clairvoyance flickering") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to accept the cave's unpredictable magic has visible cost (loss of rigid foresight), yet internal conflict plays out through summary rather than simultaneous impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to compile fragments into meaning is clear and drives her actions throughout. Her "reactively visionary" trait manifests concretely when she touches the valve and experiences visions. However, the story relies heavily on summary ("Through the night, her reactively visionary gift stirred again") rather than dramatizing internal contradiction in scene, and the final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in family trauma, with concrete embodied details like "trembling certainty" and physical interaction with the phantom punch. However, the resolution feels rushed—his "bad habits shatter" through declaration rather than dramatized struggle, and the internal transformation lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate this score.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's skepticism paired with compassionate action creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly when she attempts the ritual despite doubts. The final choice to engage with the magic square tile is earned through accumulated pressure about Kai's entangled memories. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("tangled thoughts could untangle") and the emotional progression through the transcription lacks sufficient embodied specificity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's boredom and immortal weariness are established clearly, with concrete yearning to "discover what happens after goodbye." However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—her desperation is told rather than shown through competing impulses, and the final change (knowledge gained but position unchanged) lacks sufficient visible cost to fully earn the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alex's motivation to find "mathematics of a fair trade" drives consistent choices, and the internal conflict between honesty and completing the con creates genuine tension. The character's methodical calculation of moral weights while actively waiting shows specific embodiment of their values. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "deathly vitality" and occasional diagnostic language ("liquefying rigid ethics").

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve forgotten histories through collecting temporal textures is clear and consistent. His "earnestly studious nature" manifests through precise ritual (charting lamp hums, mapping vibrations) and "incandescent restraint" in touching without grasping. The final realization that "the town's silence was no accident" sharpens his motivation but lacks fully embodied emotional cost at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The survivor's motivation to reconstruct erased histories through collected fragments is clear and consistent. The filtering of reality and nameless identity create a distinct perspective. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("filtering reality differently," "texture of memories") without sufficient embodied emotion or concrete sensory grounding during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his gloomy cheerfulness consistent, but the internal transformation feels somewhat mechanical. The final insight about "navigating transience with resilient joy" arrives through declaration rather than embodied struggle, though the character's myth-busting expertise creates genuine tension with his quest.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lanara's "orderly intuitive" trait manifests through her graffiti encoding system, and her dual allegiance creates genuine tension. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradictions in scene—we're told about her torn loyalties but don't see them clash in real-time decisions. The "hopeful desperation" feels more declared than dramatized through specific gestural or perceptual shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her purposeful curiosity drives consistent action. The internal conflict between preserving and witnessing loss creates genuine tension. However, interiority relies on abstract statements ("melancholy swelled within her") rather than embodied contradiction, and the character lacks specific flaws that complicate her vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his blindness creates genuine constraints that shape his unique repair methods. However, Mira functions more as a catalyst than a character with her own contradictions, and the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract despite the physical repair being concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's dry wit and subtle confidence manifest consistently through concrete actions and internal voice ("If I freeze before finding it, at least the maps will note my folly"). His motivation drives genuine choices under pressure, though the internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses needed for higher bands. The character reads as specific rather than archetypal, with embodied worry beneath confident exterior.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thorne's motivation is clear and his "infinitely patient" trait manifests through repeated ritual, but internal contradiction remains limited to implied tension rather than active struggle. The collective transformation at closure shows earned change through accumulated action, though individual character complexity stays surface-level.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" drives consistent choices under extreme pressure, with her override of survival instinct creating genuine internal conflict. The embodied stress ("heart raced, urging escape") and specific sensory memories ground her transformation, though the abstract nature of her goal occasionally distances us from visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited shame, driving him to seek redemption through truth-telling. The internal conflict between his skepticism and need for authentic silence plays out through concrete actions (entering the lighthouse, touching the lattice, speaking confessions). However, the ghosts' sudden appearance and his immediate understanding of their needs feels slightly unearned, and the emotional progression from doubt to peace happens too smoothly without sufficient internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation through ancestral debt and the ghost bride's lovingly venomous presence creates consistent pressure, with embodied reactions to her appearances ("heart ached with that mournful elation"). The final choice to accept both renewal and loss shows earned cost, though internal conflict could act more simultaneously rather than sequentially across her visits.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore the labyrinth is clear and consistent, but her transformation relies heavily on mystical sleepwalking rather than conscious choice under pressure. The other sleepwalkers lack individual characterization beyond their roles. Internal conflict is absent during the crucial transformation sequences where unconscious action replaces deliberate decision.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore lost faith is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we're told about her skepticism eroding "like wind on stone" rather than seeing it act through micro-choices. The "warmly curious" trait manifests in surface gestures (touching root-wrapped ribcages) without creating meaningful cost or constraint. Character change from skeptic to believer happens too smoothly without genuine struggle or blind spots driving mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization remains largely functional. While her actions of decoding chalk marks show consistency, there's minimal internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The piece tells us she "reveled in this quiet rebellion" but doesn't show the cost or risk of her pseudonym work.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her disguised foolishness creates genuine character complexity. The internal contradiction between her facade and wisdom operates throughout, though her emotional states during the embroidery lack embodied specificity. The final choice to hide the chart and maintain her disguise shows earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing messages, drawing blood with the shard). Her internal contradiction between cryptic facade and fierce tenderness drives authentic choices. The final shift from "cryptic in her solitude" to "ready to decide anew" feels earned through accumulated revelation, though the transformation could use more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives concrete choices through the translator-child interaction, with embodied details like "unsteady steps from the anesthetic's embrace." The shared anxieties between Elena and Amir create genuine emotional stakes. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("shared anxieties," "invisible threads") and the convenience of Elena's perfect dialect match.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to rediscover lost joy drives consistent choices through the dream-logic, with embodied reactions to the fresco discovery and network activation. The final choice to paint layers that feed back into the network shows agency with clear cost (her years of solitude acknowledged but transformed). Internal contradiction between melancholy and spark of remembered laughter acts throughout rather than alternating.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "exchange certainty for curiosity" drives the nested awakenings effectively, with her methodically playful nature shown through concrete restoration work and puzzle-solving with the hobo nickel. The internal journey feels earned through specific actions, though the rapid cycling through awakening layers dilutes emotional embodiment in individual moments.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias shows clear motivation through his "spark of defiance" and makes active choices leading the club's resistance, though internal contradiction remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied in scene. The final choice to use the gourd rattle demonstrates agency with visible cost (scattered escape), but earlier beats rely on declared traits ("charming rogue scholar") without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's centuries of longing drives consistent action toward reunion, but the transformation lacks embodied emotional specificity—pain "photosynthesizing" into beauty remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. The final reunion arrives without meaningful internal resistance or complication, missing the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is consistent and embodied through careful, measured actions. Her "foxglove regret" manifests in concrete gestures and choices, particularly when she discovers the cracked bamboo tube. The emotional progression from discovery to action to bittersweet acceptance shows genuine complexity without therapeutic oversimplification.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "carefully reckless" contradiction operates through concrete actions (gambling with the symphonies, risking the ink well ritual), and her final choice to restore trust carries visible emotional cost. However, Thorne remains functionally passive—he enters, observes, and accepts without meaningful resistance or counter-pressure that would deepen Elara's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between his dual heritage drives meaningful choices, particularly his integration of Mira's encrypted message into his design. However, his emotional progression feels somewhat managed—the "trembling" at revelation reads more declarative than embodied, and his final satisfaction arrives too tidily without visible personal cost beyond professional effort.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal journey from mistrust to tentative trust is earned through concrete actions. The contradiction between preserving Clara's songs while rejecting trust creates genuine tension. However, Clara remains abstract—her "deceit" lacks specificity, weakening the emotional foundation. The transformation feels somewhat mechanical in execution despite solid causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his interiority shows genuine searching, but the character remains largely static through abstract reflection rather than embodied struggle. The "featherly determined" attribute reads as label-only without constraining specific choices. His transformation from "lost child" to "seeker" is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's yearning for belonging drives consistent choices through isolation to communion, with internal contradiction between solitude and connection need. The final choice to commune with spectral guardians is earned through prior loneliness, though the emotional cost could be more visceral. "Softly ingenious" trait manifests concretely in her jury-rigged observatory construction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her role as sea-foam recollectionist provides unique character grounding, but the story lacks embodied emotional conflict in scene—most of her internal state is told through labels like "cheerful gloom" and "bittersweet resolution" rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to preserve vanished paths lacks visible personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his analytical nature drives consistent choices, particularly in orchestrating the "serendipitous" moment with Mira. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle—his plan unfolds too smoothly without meaningful resistance or cost. The transformation of Mira from monotony to creative spark happens but feels unearned given the brief interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to inscribe cosmic verse as defiance against enforced forgetting is clear and drives her ritual dance to transcendence. The internal contradiction between exile and seeking permanence plays out through embodied action—her body rooting while spirit fledges. The final transformation carries visible cost as she becomes "eternally poised" in the garden, though the emotional specificity could deepen in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "illuminate value in the mundane" consistently drives his actions from glass-crafting to the pond ritual. His internal progression from anxiety about change to "quiet strength" feels earned through the communion scene, though the transformation could be more embodied. The character reads as contemplative archetype rather than fully individualized, missing the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's motivation is clear and his scarred firefighter backstory grounds his actions, but the internal conflict lacks genuine contradiction—his "hard softness" reads more as label than embodied tension. Mia functions primarily as audience rather than applying pressure that forces Eli to choose. The final "translation" of pain into empathy feels earned through the porcelain box scene, though Eli's transformation is minimal since he begins already possessing the wisdom he shares.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation as a "logical dreamer" solving hope equations is clear but relies on conceptual abstractions rather than embodied struggle. The internal conflict between logic and dreams never manifests as simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. Her "lucidly watchful" attribute functions more as a label than a trait creating genuine cost or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation to discover "what walls dream about" creates a compelling internal drive that culminates in her discovering Silas's burden mirrors her own. The character shows genuine struggle with inherited legacy, though the epiphanic resolution ("the burden of her legacy lightened") arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient embodied cost in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "persuade mirrors to show possibilities" drives consistent action, and the borrowed heartbeat creates genuine stakes. However, the character remains more archetype than individual—we learn what he does but not who he is beyond his function. The internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he proceeds with singular purpose without visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, creating genuine stakes for redemption. The internal conflict between her need for atonement and the physical cost of the ritual lands effectively. However, interiority relies on abstract statements ("weary peace negotiator," "sought redemption") rather than embodied contradiction in scene, and emotional states are told rather than felt through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's contradictory impulses (amoral greed vs secret sentiment) act simultaneously throughout, particularly in his relationship with the extinct bird's egg. His final choice to release the water is fully earned through prior causality, destroying his empire with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around his "fractured grace" observations that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to defy conformity is clear and drives her actions, though her internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization. The "chaste courtesan" paradox creates genuine tension, and her final choice to unleash the echoes shows agency with visible cost (court's wrath). However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("defiant shield," "yearned to shatter") rather than concrete, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation from manipulative calligrapher to truth-seeking puppeteer is earned through the argument's catalyst, with concrete embodiment in his handling of the story stick and puppet prototype. The internal shift feels genuine but the epiphanic language ("half-lit epiphanies flickered") tends toward abstraction rather than embodied contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to honor overlooked histories drives consistent choices through building ephemeral monuments, though the internal contradiction between orchestration and witnessing could be sharper. The final renunciation—releasing control to allow collaborative meaning—shows earned change with visible cost in his "transient roots pulling free."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through "technically gentle" precision, with forgiveness creating genuine character change. The internal journey from guilt to resolve feels earned, though some emotional transitions ("snowmelt ardor") lean toward abstract labeling rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's gift of "foresight through hindsight" creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly in the dream sequence where she must interpret past fragments to glimpse future paths. The final transformation where she becomes "chosen" rather than wanderer feels earned through her journey's accumulated cost, though some interior passages lean toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to bridge empirical science with mystical forces is clear and consistent, driving him to the covenant ritual. However, his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—his "irony" is stated rather than shown through competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final covenant acceptance shows agency but the emotional cost remains abstract ("quiet triumph") rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's scheming pacifism manifests through concrete manipulative actions (using the pin to unlock cellular memory, guiding Thorne's gestures), with clear motivation rooted in her past. Thorne's transformation from rigid resentment to release is earned through embodied memory work, though his initial characterization relies slightly on telling ("eyes burning with resentment"). The final choice to release carries visible cost through physical convulsion and the fracturing of long-held anger.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is grounded in the concrete loss of his wife's memory, and his contradictory nature (firmly grounded yet longing for the ethereal) creates authentic tension. The synchronized breathing sequence shows embodied struggle with "chest rose and fell in harmony," though some moments lean toward abstraction ("boundaries dissolved completely"). His final achievement carries visible emotional cost as he bridges the divide between flesh and fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to pass wisdom to Lila is clear and drives his risky climb, with his grief over lost wife and daughter providing consistent emotional grounding. The final choice to let the notebook fall "accidentally" reveals layered intention beneath his feisty exterior. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and Lila's instant understanding lacks the resistance that would make the wisdom transfer feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's bewilderment and motivation are consistently embodied through concrete actions (pressing the cameo to glass, entering the bathroom sanctuary). His internal contradiction between curator duty and forbidden knowledge pursuit creates genuine tension. The final choice to "curate nonlinear threads" shows earned transformation, though some philosophical passages lean toward abstract articulation rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's resourcefulness manifests through concrete actions (cross-referencing the botanical diary with guardian laws, finding the chronal lily loophole), and Thorne's desperation drives the quest forward with clear stakes. The characters make consequential choices under pressure, particularly Elara's strategic negotiation with the guardians. However, both characters lean toward archetype (the careful scholar, the desperate time traveler) without sufficient internal contradiction or embodied emotion during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's dual identity as chimera twin discoverer creates genuine internal conflict with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously throughout. The final integration of twin essence shows earned change through concrete narrative action. However, some passages drift into abstract emotional labeling ("blissfully aberrant harmony") rather than fully embodied states, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's warmly methodical nature drives consistent choices through pressure, with her archivist expertise enabling the rope reconfiguration that resolves the conflict. Her motivation is clear and embodied through action rather than declaration. However, internal contradiction feels somewhat abstract ("confusion into clarity") and emotional embodiment relies on stock phrases like "heart quickened."

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find "quiet in the storm" drives consistent choices through examining ice and conjuring the bloom, with embodied tension ("steps deliberate against invisible gales"). The transformation from passive guardian to active peace-forger shows clear arc with cost. However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("true peace wasn't fragile silence but a hammered repose") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the energy beings remain faceless forces without specific pressure that would elevate character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - proving coincidences have meaning drives every choice. Her retrocognitive gift creates concrete embodied visions rather than abstract insights. The final choice to search the thistles shows her values through action with visible cost (bleeding hands). However, internal conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized contradiction, and emotional progression feels somewhat linear.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Archivist's motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" drives concrete actions (measuring shadows, taking notations), and her preemptive nostalgia creates genuine tension between preservation and loss. However, the character remains somewhat abstract—we see her professional role clearly but lack the personal stakes or contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization. The final transformation from "just an archivist" to "a bridge" feels declared rather than dramatized through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his chanting as shield against despair, with concrete internal conflict between hopelessness and creative drive. The final choice to reignite his passion is earned through the mosaic's message and fire-spinning action, with visible emotional cost in his tears. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("gravity of hopelessness") and slightly convenient epiphany timing.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's warmly observant nature manifests through concrete actions—placing the jade cicada, reading pool patterns, offering tangential wisdom. Elara's internal conflict ("What if I can't let go?") emerges from embodied tension (twisted fingers, shallow breath), though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("seeking closure").

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's claustrophobia drives consistent motivation from bunker oppression to sky-seeking, with embodied fear ("clawed at her like invisible vines") and concrete desire. The final transformation from claustrophobia "sprouting into something new—a resilient openness" shows earned change through specific action. Loses points for some abstract emotional labeling ("resilient openness") and convenient emotional resolution that feels slightly unearned given the depth of the initial trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" is grounded in personal loss and manifests through concrete micro-choices (adjusting pole rhythm, using the storm glass as teaching tool). Mira's transformation from "sharp and insistent" to "whispering thanks" tracks causally, though her internal shift could use more embodied contradiction during the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "wisely adventurous" trait manifests in calculated risk-taking, but internal contradiction remains largely abstract ("caution of ancient scholars with the daring of quantum explorers"). The final choice to claim the throne lacks embodied emotional cost—we see the action but not the felt price of merging with the throne's essence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "teach the suffocating to breathe" drives consistent choices through deliberate bridge-burning and tender shadow-keeping. The contradiction between isolation and compassion creates genuine tension. However, Lorin's transformation happens too quickly without sufficient embodied struggle, and some interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("loaded emptiness") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to transform pressure into diamonds is clear and rooted in her pyramid scheme trauma, with the "virtuously mischievous" trait demonstrated through concrete actions like the spore-sharing. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves too smoothly from receiving messages to volunteering without genuine hesitation or cost-weighing that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as dynasty ender is clear and compelling, with internal contradiction between exile and return creating genuine tension. The embodied details of turning the crank handle and feeling vibrations through bones ground the emotional stakes. However, the revelation sequence relies on convenient spectral voices rather than earned character action, and the final resolution feels too tidy for the complexity established.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elandor's motivation to "capture the shape of possibility" drives his ritual with the marionette program, and his transformation from withdrawn knight to orchard guardian shows meaningful change with cost (losing his old constraints). However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—his "shivering bliss" reads more as consistent enthusiasm than genuine tension between opposing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing dust patterns and following trails. The emotional progression from "broken heart" to "possibility" tracks believably through the discovered parallel between the button gift and her ex's apology note. However, the healing resolution feels slightly accelerated, and some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("fractured soul," "mend something").

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent throughout—preserving forbidden truths against indifference—with embodied emotion in her fleeing through rain-slicked streets clutching the key. The character shows resourcefulness under pressure (adjusting the broadcast method using the lagoon's reflective surface), though some interiority relies on abstract descriptors ("burned fierce") rather than embodied specificity. Her final choice to reveal herself knowing capture looms demonstrates earned agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The saxophonist's motivation to silence prophecies is clear and consistent, driving concrete actions through the piece. His use of musical negative space as a method reveals character-specific expertise. However, the piece lacks embodied emotional contradiction during peak moments—his nostalgia is stated rather than felt through specific physical responses or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her monument-building method with embodied joy ("heart bubbled with joy," "mossy glee"). The transformation at closure—from solitary seed sorter to partnered prophet-reader—carries visible cost through the "chaotic joy" that disrupts her orderly world. However, internal contradiction could be sharper; her delight never meaningfully tensions against her orderly nature.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's transformation from rigid planner to improviser is earned through concrete beats, particularly the compass discovery triggering his shift. The "uncertainly certain" paradox manifests in specific actions like using the pendulum to read the waterfall's rhythm. However, interiority occasionally relies on abstract declarations ("befriend uncertainty") rather than fully embodied contradiction, and the emotional cost of abandoning his meticulous ways could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation rooted in past failure with Aurora, and his internal conflict between regret and redemption drives the closure choice. The transformation from "luminous regret" to acceptance is earned through concrete alchemical action. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "equilibrium reigned, gilded and whole" rather than embodied sensation, and emotional progression feels somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "integrate laughter into healing" manifests concretely when she infuses lighter tones into the harp's melody, drawing out Thorne's reluctant smile and rusty laugh. The transformation of the crocodile's tooth from guilt symbol to release object shows earned change through specific embodied action. However, Elara's internal experience remains somewhat distant - we see her methods but limited contradictory impulses or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's proprioceptive enhancement creates genuine embodied tension ("her enhanced proprioception screaming the precise angle of her lean, the strain in her tendons"), and her trauma response sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. However, the mathematical mercy epiphany arrives too cleanly ("forgiveness equaled pain divided by time, multiplied by shared humanity") without sufficient earned struggle, and the interrogator's complexity remains sketched rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving her actions through the lighthouse lens. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract—she experiences determination but not contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "between-worlds translator" concept functions more as a label than embodied characterization affecting her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" drives consistent choices through dust analysis to freeing ghosts, with his parents' death providing earned backstory that anchors his gift. The ghosts manifest distinct personalities through gesture (ringmaster pointing, juggler tossing), though their emotional states could be more embodied. The final choice to wind the mainspring counterclockwise shows clear agency with visible cost (the weightless burden lifting).

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to compress eternity crystallizes through concrete action—studying frost patterns, deploying the bottled whisper, operating his press—with embodied urgency in "his heart quickened." The internal contradiction between preserving the library's perfection and deliberately rupturing it creates genuine tension, though the beloved's echo remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation as a defunct revolutionary seeking redemption through archaeological reinterpretation is clear and consistent. His discovery of the crystal shard and recognition of "a kindred spirit across the ages" creates genuine resonance. However, the character lacks embodied emotional contradiction during key moments—his burnished sorrow reads more as stated mood than lived experience through specific gestures or perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to restore stolen light is clear and consistent, driving him through doubt toward resolution. However, his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—the moment of doubt about his mentor's betrayal reads as summary rather than visceral struggle. The ferns-as-truth-gauge provides a concrete external manifestation of honesty, though emotional states remain largely told ("wonder in his eyes") rather than embodied through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens through three "hinged awakenings" that compound her understanding. Her transformation from eccentric collector to one who discovers "where explanations fail" is earned through concrete psychometry visions and embodied experience in the lagoon. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("resonance guiding her onward") in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as a sculptor who seeks to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" drives credible choices throughout, particularly her immediate sculpting response to the magical discovery. Her "perpetually learning" trait manifests in concrete actions rather than labels. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed—she moves from discovery to artistic epiphany too smoothly, lacking the internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate this to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's legacy, with concrete embodiment through her art and quest. The internal journey from "quietly driven" searching to "gentle knowing" shows earned progression. However, the emotional states are often told rather than embodied ("Tears came softly"), and the character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation burns with clarity and his retrocognitive entrapment creates genuine internal conflict through embodied visions. The shift from archivist to activist embodiment works, though the specter's motivations remain somewhat abstract ("FEAR DIVIDED US"). Final choice to offer forgiveness shows values hierarchy with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to rebuild through genuine effort rather than magical shortcuts is clear and consistent. His rejection of the bottle's false comfort demonstrates embodied internal conflict. However, the apprentices and returning townsfolk lack individualization, and the emotional progression from solitude to community leadership feels somewhat compressed without sufficient embodied cost at the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and consistent, driving his immersion ritual with the wax cylinder. The internal conflict between his fear of obsolescence and duty to preserve humanity's emotional rhythms creates genuine tension. However, the transformation from archivist to accidental prophet feels somewhat unearned—the causality between his ritual and the prophecy's fulfillment lacks sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to discover "the texture of borrowed time" drives concrete action through the vortex ritual, with embodied tension ("hands trembled," "furiously tranquil thoughts"). The final choice to enter the vortex shows earned agency with visible cost ("lives unlived," "thorns of regret"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("wild serenity eternal in her soul") that weakens the otherwise grounded characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's core motivation—favoring listening over noise—drives a consistent arc from maintenance work through the climactic decision to trust silence over sirens, with visible cost in his doubt. The internal conflict between pulling the rope and trusting his quiet method creates genuine tension, though the emotional texture could deepen beyond contemplative steadiness.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find strength in vulnerability is consistently dramatized through her connection with falling stars, though her internal conflict relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The closure choice to embrace her role as "guardian of vulnerabilities" feels earned through the established pattern of empathizing with cosmic descent, but lacks the visceral cost needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's tranquil perception drives authentic discovery through observation rather than action, with his motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" creating genuine internal tension. The character work succeeds through embodied details like his methodical unearthing of the box and contemplative gazing, though the emotional progression could push further into contradictory impulses during the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand time's texture is clear and embodied through concrete details like hourglass tattoos and borrowed moments "crumbling in her pockets." The final choice to share understanding shows earned change, though the transformation feels somewhat abstract without visible personal cost beyond the existing borrowed-time constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to find beauty in the incomplete drives authentic choices throughout, particularly his decision to heal through poetry rather than physical means. The internal consistency holds as he approaches the drake with characteristic gentleness, though the creature's psychology remains somewhat opaque. His final acceptance of imperfect healing aligns with established traits, creating earned closure with visible cost in the drake's remaining scars.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "brazen calm" response to terminal diagnosis creates a distinct character stance, but the internal experience remains abstract rather than embodied. The choice to dedicate remaining time to interspecies communication is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. No genuine struggle or cost appears in his decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her luminous skepticism and quest to understand homecoming's chemistry. The internal contradiction between accepting alien enhancements while rebelling against integration works well. However, the other pilgrims remain underdeveloped sketches, and Elara's final realization feels slightly unearned given the limited dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Coachman's motivation is clear and his attribute of speaking dead languages enables the central action convincingly. However, he lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle - he executes his mission without meaningful internal conflict or cost to himself. The character functions more as a mythic agent than a fully realized individual with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to find her brother and "translate distance into closeness" drives consistent choices through discovering the leaf, solving the riddle, and pursuing the coordinates. Tracker's loyalty and retired-but-stirring instincts create a compelling secondary layer. The final choice to "chase closeness across the scrap-strewn void" shows agency despite uncertainty, though the emotional complexity could deepen beyond hope/doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (sketching, exploring), with good internal consistency. The "blessed pariah" paradox creates genuine character tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around her temporal gift that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elarion's motivation is clear and consistent—honor-driven thievery to restore cosmic balance. His "sacredly playful" approach manifests in concrete actions like dancing between wards. The character arc completes with earned resolution, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the chess piece swap sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex's transformation from crisis actor to survivor creates a clear motivation arc, and his "benevolently ruthless" trait manifests in concrete actions like the spelled walking pattern. However, the nomadic penumbra entity lacks embodied presence as an antagonist, and Alex's internal conflict remains more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to understand home and recover buried talents is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in the ritual sequence with the feather and stone. The internal conflict between substituting reality for comfort versus confronting painful truth creates genuine tension. However, the transformation from passive forgetting to active recovery feels slightly rushed in the final third, and some emotional beats rely on abstract declarations ("hidden thunder in her veins") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to forgive himself drives consistent choices through concrete actions (fidgeting with labyrinth, decoding tapestry), with internal conflict between guilt and determination embodied in his "fierce repose." The final self-forgiveness lands with earned cost through specific acknowledgment of his chess mistake. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("knot of self-blame") and limited embodiment of emotion beyond the fidgeting gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by guilt over her brother's betrayal. The "innocently mischievous" trait manifests in her artistic defiance and playful poetry. However, the brother remains abstract—we never see the specific betrayal dramatized, only referenced, which weakens the emotional grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elowen's uncertainty drives genuine internal conflict between doubt and necessity, with embodied stress (burning lungs, trembling hands) grounding abstract motivation. The kintsugi metaphor effectively externalizes his internal repair work, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("quilting memories together into a cohesive tapestry"). The final transformation from uncertain to convicted feels earned through the ritual's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to confront his past loss is clear and consistent, with the "intimately aloof" trait effectively constraining his relationships. The transformation from guarded nostalgia to acceptance shows genuine change with visible cost. However, the epiphany in the grotto feels slightly unearned—the painted seashell's magical projection undermines the psychological realism established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conviction about whispers versus shouts drives the story, but the resolution strains credibility when Mira appears alive after years presumed dead. The character's obsession feels genuine, yet the miraculous reunion undercuts the earned cost that the setup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The patchwork navigator's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—"fingers—mismatched, one bone, one brass"—and internal contradiction between loss and wholeness. The character's transformation from passive recipient to active guide lands with earned cost: "whole in their fragmentation." Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "geography of loss" metaphor that occasionally supersedes concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to build psychological safety against empathy echoes is clear and consistent, driving her to perform the ritual. However, her involuntary truthfulness trait, while mentioned multiple times, doesn't create meaningful obstacles or force difficult choices—it's more label than lived constraint. The character lacks internal contradiction in the moment; she proceeds with rational determination without wrestling with doubt or competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's eccentric traits and isolation are well-established, and his motivation to decode the stranger's gesture drives clear action. The borrowed memories create internal conflict between his chosen solitude and newfound connection. However, the visions feel somewhat passive—Elias observes rather than struggles with contradictory impulses in scene, and the final choice to seek missing pieces lacks visible cost beyond ending his isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is grounded in Clara's deathbed promise and his empirically intuitive nature manifests through concrete actions (following ants, reading the matrix chip's patterns). The transformation from lonely dealer to someone with "fresh eyes" feels earned through his journey, though the emotional complexity could deepen during the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's disenchantment and dream-driven obsession create clear motivation, with concrete embodied details like "heat kiss her skin" and physical climbing. The final revelation that her council deceived her provides earned reversal with visible cost. However, Lir remains underdeveloped beyond "loyal but wary," and some emotional transitions feel rushed, particularly Elara's instant processing of the betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "capture the density of presence" drives meaningful action and her transformation from hesitant friend to resolved romantic partner lands with cost. However, Thorne remains underdeveloped beyond his confession, and some interiority relies on abstract labels ("scientifically romantic soul") rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to chronicle and tame chaos is clear and consistent, with embodied tension between jealousy of past selves and the burden of foresight. The final choice to transform "envy into elevation" feels earned through the lucid dream sequence, though the emotional progression from jealousy to acceptance happens somewhat quickly without sufficient intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's loss of smell creating her career pivot is well-motivated, and her shift from sensing invisible essences to measuring visible flow shows clear internal logic. The connection forged with Mira through shared vulnerability of loss lands effectively. However, Mira's emotional arc feels slightly rushed in the final third, and some interiority relies on abstractions ("inner turmoil," "quiet tremor of peace") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to transform trauma into empowering narrative is well-established through concrete backstory and embodied stress response (crystallization). The physical manifestation of stress as crystal formation provides strong embodied emotion. Internal conflict between needing perfect focus and stress-induced paralysis creates genuine tension. Deduction for slight therapy-speak in "transform scars into stories" framing.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - seeking forgiveness for past betrayal through her unique exorcist method. The internal conflict between her professional persona and personal guilt creates genuine tension. However, Lila remains more symbolic presence than realized character, and some emotional beats feel declared rather than embodied ("tears tracing paths through the archive's dust").

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Witness functions more as a philosophical vessel than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation is clear but abstract ("to unravel cosmic illusions"), and while the journey inward/outward creates some tension, there's no genuine internal conflict or micro-choices revealing character under pressure. The piece relies on conceptual declaration rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to understand "what clocks really measure" drives concrete actions throughout, from calibrating the hydraulic system to using the inherited key. His countdown through memories reveals contradictory impulses—seeking truth while fearing what he might find. The final realization that clocks measure "the soul's horizon, the razor edges where self met the infinite" represents genuine internal transformation with conceptual cost, though the abstract nature of this insight slightly weakens embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to understand "the physics of letting go" effectively drives her choices and creates genuine internal contradiction between holding on and release. The parallel drawn between fungal barriers and emotional permeability works well. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient emotional resolution with Kai, though the cost of confronting grief registers clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal contradictions between rigid calculation and yearning for controlled chaos manifest through concrete choices (following graffiti, lighting the lantern), though her transformation feels somewhat predetermined. The "clover melancholy" emotional texture is embodied effectively through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to "teach endings how to begin" through cultivated estrangement is clear and consistent, driving concrete actions throughout. The final reversal where he becomes subject to his own lesson feels earned through prior causality. However, interiority relies on summary ("knowing his method worked") rather than embodied contradiction, and the musician's convenience in recognizing Elias strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve ephemeral moments is clear and consistent, driving his ritual at the jetty. The internal progression from grief to "haunted euphoria" shows genuine emotional complexity. However, the transformation relies heavily on abstract descriptions ("spectral whispers," "ghostly presence") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene, and Mira remains more symbol than person.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's desperate loneliness drives authentic choices throughout, with his jocular mask creating genuine internal contradiction. The ensemble cast applies meaningful pressure through their shared vulnerability, though individual secondary characters lack distinct embodiment beyond their occupational labels. The final transformation from isolation to connection is earned through the reciprocal storytelling, with visible cost in his abandoned elusiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation—navigating grief after his lover's death—drives consistent choices throughout, with embodied sensory absorption and the quiet blaze metaphor creating genuine interiority. The final transformation from grief to acceptance feels earned through the journey's accumulated sensory languages, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without deeper internal contradiction at the stillpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "confidently uncertain" trait manifests through her assured doubts about readings while trusting the process enough to act, creating genuine internal contradiction. The final choice to edit history carries visible cost (isolation, the weight of changing reality), though the emotional aftermath could be more embodied rather than stated as "profound peace."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation from forgotten composer to rediscovering music through mapped silence shows clear motivation with embodied melancholy ("ghost haunting his own memories"). The joyful sorrow at closure lands with earned cost, though Thorne's characterization relies heavily on "quietly charismatic" labeling rather than demonstrated complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his promise to Mira, with concrete embodied emotion ("volcanic tenderness" manifested through trembling fingers, quiet sobs). The "analytically intuitive" trait drives specific actions (decoding chisel marks, recognizing patterns). Internal contradiction appears when his arsonist guilt confronts his guardian role, earning the final transformation. Deduction for some label-speak ("analytically intuitive" repeated without variation) and slight emotional tidiness in resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to reclaim her lost beloved through experimental memory entanglement is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly her rebellious escape to the garden and drumming ritual. However, the internal contradiction between hope and doubt feels more sequential than simultaneous, and the final ambiguity ("truly him or merely the echo") arrives without sufficient embodied struggle to earn its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and drives his orchestrated challenge, with his unique ability to identify people by walks providing consistent character-specific perception. The contest between whispers and shouts creates genuine stakes with Marcus's defeat embodying the cost. Minor deduction for some telling about motivation rather than pure embodiment, and Marcus reads more functional than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (guilt over theft) is clear but arrives through exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The guardian remains a cipher—his teaching impulse lacks grounded motivation beyond archetype. The resolution "I'll make it right" feels unearned without showing the internal struggle that precedes confession.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to plant "forests of second thoughts" drives consistent action, and his chess coach identity shapes his tactical approach. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract—we see his gift but not contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final smile suggests satisfaction but lacks the embodied cost or internal tension that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's yearning for freedom and Marek's fear of loss create genuine contradictory impulses that act in scene, particularly in their dock confrontation. The transformation into a sea creature feels somewhat abrupt without sufficient embodied foreshadowing, though the scrimshaw's power to unlock hearts provides partial causality. The final choice carries visible cost in Marek's abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's moral ambiguity manifests through concrete contradictory actions—reporting neighbors while secretly helping others—with embodied grief in his handling of the dried flowers and whittling. His theatrical narration method reveals character-specific coping under oppression. The "blank-faced performer" constraint drives choices throughout, though some interiority relies on telling rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's aesthetically driven motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete actions like tracing the quartz and paraphrasing incantations. The internal journey from yearning poet to fulfilled communer tracks causally, though the transformation lacks deeper contradiction or struggle—he gets what he wants without meaningful internal resistance or cost to his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking beauty in imperfection through his colorblind lens—and his innocently cunning nature manifests in concrete actions like arranging plants to trick spirits. The internal conflict between wanting color vision and ultimately choosing his flawed grace shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for the spirit's somewhat convenient compliance with the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization relies heavily on conceptual abstractions ("powerfully gentle touch," "texture of connection") rather than embodied contradictions. The final realization about connection as "golden shadow" lacks the specific earned cost that would elevate the character arc. Her internal journey progresses too smoothly without genuine struggle or meaningful mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (crafting mourning jewelry, leaving origami coordinates), and his subdued ardor manifests believably through restrained gestures. However, Lira's transformation feels rushed—her shift from hollow-eyed wanderer to willing participant lacks the intermediate psychological beats needed for credibility, and the tattoo decision arrives too quickly without sufficient internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara and Marcus are competently drawn with clear motivations - her steadily curious nature drives the cartomancy practice, his guilt compels confession. The transformation from crypto baron to seeker of redemption lands with adequate cost. However, both characters lean heavily on archetypal roles (mystic guide, fallen magnate) without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and embodied through her erratic dance and emotional responses. However, the character lacks specific internal contradiction beyond the generic "anguished joy" template, and her transformation reads more as discovery than earned change through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "preserve the shape of hope" drives consistent action through binding the shadow, with internal contradiction between confronting her past regret and protecting the library's harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal journey from betrayal to reconstruction shows clear motivation and embodied emotion through concrete actions (tearing maps, handling the tail tip). However, the transformation feels somewhat mechanical—his shift from "fragile convictions" to "resilient" ones occurs through symbolic actions rather than genuine internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her gift compelling, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene - we get summary ("seeking closure often meant reliving the pain") rather than active struggle. The final acceptance feels earned through accumulation but needed more visceral cost during the procedure itself.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and specific ("to find where unused love is stored"), with concrete embodied action through psychometry. The internal progression from seeking to understanding feels earned through the film strip visions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unused love" that could be more grounded in specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to free trapped creativity is clearly established, but the character lacks embodied contradiction and specific flaws that would elevate the piece.

Her transformation from stifled to liberated occurs without sufficient internal resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's dreamless state as both burden and gift creates genuine internal contradiction, and his motivation to "cultivate sparks in unlit corners" drives concrete action through the archive encounter. The transformation from passive guard to active cultivator is earned through his unique perceptual ability, though some interiority borders on abstract ("fractured song echoed, charming sparks to life through waves of possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to rediscover his mind's "wild frontier" drives consistent action through the gear discovery and wind-listening progression, with embodied stress responses like tears at closure. The internal journey from rigid scholar to sovereign philosopher shows earned transformation through concrete steps. However, the character lacks meaningful internal contradiction during peak moments—his pursuit remains too linear without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like the "broken leash" and trembling hand, with internal conflict shown through her "gently persistent" resolve against thickening fog. The characterization loses points for some abstract phrasing ("unused courage waits") and the guides Mira and Thorne function more as archetypal facilitators than fully realized characters with their own pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's mute condition and guilt create genuine internal contradiction, with embodied details like "regenerating nerves tingling with phantom pains." The choice to remain at the fortress shows earned endurance with visible cost. However, the revelation about Mira feels slightly convenient, and some emotional transitions lack the messiness of real trauma response.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and her titan-in-child-form contradiction creates compelling tension. Her patient, methodical approach through cryptic messages shows consistent characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation builds from coral bleaching trauma through rhythmic tapping to the father's confession, with visible cost in tears and isolation. The tapping habit effectively embodies her communion with ocean patterns, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("drifting moored existence"). The final choice to share the revelation carries earned weight from her witnessing role and father's betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her barefoot rebellion shows character-specific defiance, but internal contradiction lacks embodied complexity. The epiphany sequence ("visions flooded her mind") arrives through abstract summary rather than earned struggle, and emotional progression jumps from searching to understanding without intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's insurgent motivation and plant-telepathy create genuine internal tension, particularly when the lilies urge "Decode it, elder one."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied trauma response ("body reacted first," "tightening in his chest") and credible PTSD portrayal with somatic markers driving the climactic freeze. The transformation from paralysis to movement feels earned through accumulated detail, though "optimism felt grounded" edges toward telling rather than embodying the change.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to capture essence in portraits and his descent into necessary darkness are clear and embodied through concrete details like "dulled eyes" and trembling hands. The internal conflict between artistic failure and the compulsion to redesign reality plays out through action. However, the transformation at the end feels slightly unearned—the mechanism of how untangling threads leads to artistic renewal needed more causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and embodied through his "serene anger" and scientific quest, with concrete stakes tied to family tragedy. The character shows consistent internal coherence but lacks genuine contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—his anger and curiosity align too neatly. The final discovery provides closure but the emotional cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between duty and exposure drives meaningful choices, particularly her decisive transmission of the letter. The "bravely conflicted" attribute manifests through concrete action with visible cost. However, emotional embodiment relies on stock phrases ("hands trembled," "heart pounded") and the transformation from conflicted to resolved feels abrupt rather than earned through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's pacifist stance against her father's violent trade provides clear motivation, and her "senselessly perceptive" gift manifests concretely in detecting "whispers in the wind" and "subtle shifts in soil." The character makes consistent micro-choices (creating the sheath, teaching patience to roses), though internal contradiction could be sharper during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eron's cool-headed characterization holds consistently through sensory chaos, with his method of "voicing silence" revealing character-specific expertise. The final choice to release rather than possess shows earned renunciation with visible cost ("watching it zigzag back into the garden's embrace"). Minor deduction for some abstract emotional states ("his heart stirred") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover truth and protect family legacy drives consistent choices, though her internal conflict remains somewhat abstract. The final shift from passive observation to active intervention earns its cost through prior causality. Interiority occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("orbits of regret—that was how she thought of them") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's guilt over abandoning her daughter drives consistent motivation throughout, with embodied grief ("tears streamed down Elara's face") and a meaningful endurance at closure where she accepts forgiveness. The internal conflict between guilt and redemption acts simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete action through the mandala creation, with her social perceptiveness enabling key insights about the group's interconnected struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his retrocognitive curse creates genuine internal conflict through vivid flashbacks that interrupt action. The renaming ritual represents a meaningful choice with visible cost, though the automaton's transformation feels slightly abrupt without sufficient embodied resistance or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's synesthesia creates a distinctive perceptual signature, and her despair motivates the journey credibly. However, Silas's motivation feels slightly convenient ("kindred despair"), and both characters lack the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate this category—their arcs proceed too smoothly from despair to hope without genuine internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex's skeptical-yet-affectionate stance creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly when the telepathic experience forces him to navigate between doubt and hope. The somatic marker method provides concrete embodied decision-making. However, Mia remains underdeveloped as a pressure source, and some emotional transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("Affection swelled in his chest, tempered by skepticism").

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" drives consistent action through exploration and mapping. However, her internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - she proceeds with unwavering purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eland's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming prophecy through shared wisdom—with embodied details like "hands calloused from flipping the endless timers." The internal drive manifests through concrete actions (cataloging buttons, unscrambling the echo) rather than mere declaration. However, his emotional response to the prophecy's transformation feels slightly underdeveloped; we see methodical work but limited internal contradiction or struggle during the crucial unscrambling sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through the pillbox and his patient waiting, with internal contradiction between his burned status and determination to repair.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to unravel his lineage's mystery is clear and consistent, driving his patient examination of the palimpsest. His internal progression from complexity to distilled essence feels earned through concrete action with the needle. However, the transformation lacks visceral embodiment—his calm remains too static throughout, missing opportunities for contradictory impulses to act simultaneously in scene during the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's zen-minded characterization and pottery background effectively motivate his patient quest, with concrete embodiment ("hands callused from years"). The internal motivation to understand persistence is clear and consistent. However, his reaction to the fractured timelines feels somewhat passive - he navigates them but doesn't face genuine internal conflict or make a costly choice that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—tending fire escape gardens, adjusting prisms with precise tools. Her "wistfully pragmatic" nature manifests in how she accepts the rosebush's death while channeling purpose into protecting bioluminescent creatures.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her reincarnation memory, driving her from isolation toward independence through spectral communion. The "brittle awakenings" metaphor effectively embodies her fragile emotional state, and her final renunciation of dependence on extinct echoes shows earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation as keeper of secrets who yearns for his own connection is clear and drives the installation choice. The whimsical trait manifests in concrete actions (seeing the twig spiral as thread incarnate, creating the floating lantern installation). However, Mira's sudden appearance and recognition feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality, and her immediate understanding of his need lacks the resistance expected under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority ("hands trembled slightly") and embodied stress. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneity—her cautious hope and wariness alternate rather than clash in scene. The resolution feels somewhat convenient; her counter-frequency solution works too smoothly without genuine struggle or meaningful cost beyond vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction—he explores tunnels despite fearing them, with embodied tension ("breath quickened," "clawed at him"). The final transformation from claustrophobia to "boundless possibility" lands with earned cost through his sustained struggle. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("prudently adventurous spirit," "wistful rebellion") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's prosopagnosia creates a compelling lens for investigation, and his methodical approach reveals character through specific action. The awakening of dormant empathy provides a clear arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to honor her ancestor is clear and drives her actions, with the "nervously confident" trait manifested through physical gestures and internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand cycles is clear and consistent, driving his choices from sanctuary-seeking through startup creation to territorial defense. The final renunciation (choosing markers over confrontation) carries visible cost and breaks his father's violent pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions and heal through words drives concrete actions (entering lucid dreams, responding to Thorne).

    Elowen's guarded nature and warlike serenity create genuine internal contradiction, particularly when she must "unbend" her own rigidity alongside the ice. The transformation from defensive isolation to vulnerable revelation is earned through concrete struggle, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("walls she'd built that mirrors couldn't penetrate"). Her motivation to discover hidden truths drives consistent action through expanding circles methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's purposeful curiosity drives concrete choices through the scar-linking sequence, with contradictory impulses (anxious elation) acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives her choices through concrete embodied details like the burned tarot card and her "fiercely gentle" nature manifesting in specific actions. The internal contradiction between recklessness and gentleness plays out in scene through her willingness to inherit her brother's torment. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "patching holes in souls" that occasionally drifts toward therapy-speak, though it's grounded in the magical conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jack's motivation and internal conflict are well-established through the failed TV valuation and his transition from roadie to appraiser, with "insulating emotionally with facts" showing defensive coping.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's methodical nature manifests consistently through patient translation work and careful seed-planting ritual, with genuine grief driving his quest.

    The librarian's motivation to "preserve wonder in the routine" is clearly stated but relies heavily on exposition rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation from isolation to connection bearer is earned through concrete discovery and ritual, with embodied reactions like "warmth spread through his fingers."

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias's guilt over his brother's drowning provides clear, consistent motivation that intensifies through medication withdrawal into raw emotional states. The internal conflict between seeking redemption and confronting unbearable guilt drives authentic choices, particularly in how he traces maps and graffiti for meaning. His final acceptance that "self-forgiveness wasn't about erasing the flood but honoring the new path it carved" shows earned transformation through concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, driven by her quest to preserve unspoken words.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's kindly decisive trait manifests through concrete actions with Lir, and her forgiveness of betrayal carries genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong contradictory impulses act throughout - Elias's "sincerely insincere" performance masks genuine vulnerability that surfaces at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to teach through withholding is clear and consistent, but Lir remains underdeveloped beyond receptive apprentice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The skimmer's motivation to "navigate without moving" represents genuine internal conflict, but the execution relies heavily on abstract description rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking authentic creation in an automated world—and his final tears show embodied emotion at closure. However, internal conflict operates mostly through summary ("underachiever," "quiet motivation") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The character's flaw (weak magic) doesn't meaningfully complicate his choices or create mistakes that compound.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—discovering the color of sound drives every action from lamp-tending to diving into the sunken library. The internal quest crystallizes through embodied sensation ("the blue crash of waves, the golden hum") and culminates in genuine synesthetic revelation. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where the tag immediately grants his wish without deeper struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "wavelength align with purpose" drives concrete actions through coin-casting and static distillation, with embodied tension in trembling hands and steady breath.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and grounded in his role as memory-keeper for the drowned town, with concrete embodied moments (tracing photograph edges, gathering descendants). The internal conflict between burying grief and confronting memory acts simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's core motivation to harmonize logic and intuition is clearly stated and drives the alchemical transformation, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—her sentimentality is told through pressed petals rather than shown through conflicting impulses during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve trust under pressure drives consistent choices through the crisis, with embodied stress shown through physical interaction with the parachute buckle.

    Elias's motivation to safeguard creative spaces drives genuine choices, and his receptive curiosity enables the seed's imaginative transformation. However, his internal experience relies on abstract states ("curiosity," "intrigued") rather than embodied contradiction, and the emotional progression from struggle to renewed resolve feels too smooth without visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's spectral motivation is clear and consistent—restoring joy to his grieving family through gentle persistence rather than force. The "mournfully eager" characterization manifests effectively in his nightly ritual with the ghostly leaf blower. Deduction for slight abstraction in emotional states ("shadowed grief," "unspoken sorrow") rather than fully embodied specificity, though the final transformation shows concrete change through "muffled chuckles" and shared memories.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's motivation to befriend uncertainty and the internal journey from homesickness to acceptance shows clear progression with embodied details like "cold to seep into its bones while the pendant warmed." The transformation from exile's torment to "fragile peace" is earned through the interiorization process, though some passages lean toward abstract philosophizing ("light's limits were not barriers but invitations") rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's hopelessness and stoic sensitivity are consistently embodied through his actions and internal experience, particularly in his methodical destruction-creation cycles. The transformation from hopelessness to renewed purpose feels earned through the successive approximation process. However, the epiphany "the curse was not eternal, but a stifling illusion" arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient dramatized discovery, and some interiority relies on abstract descriptors ("stoically sensitive grace") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions of climbing, tuning, and interpreting. The philosophy of "finding beginnings in endings" earned through mentor's loss provides consistent drive. However, internal contradiction lacks scene-level tension—she moves with too much certainty for someone seeking personal answers, missing the embodied struggle that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation as an optimist who sees magic in the ferry is clear and consistent, driving his actions when reality shifts. However, his internal experience lacks embodied contradiction—he feels only "thrill" and "excitement" during the crisis, missing the complex emotional layering required for higher scores. The resolution shows him saving everyone through positivity, but the personal cost of merging timelines isn't felt in his character.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to discover "the texture of connection" after losing his sister drives consistent choices through weaving sinew patterns, though internal contradiction could be sharper. The final moment where he "grazes the texture of connection at last—warm, fibrous, like sinew itself" pays off his quest with embodied specificity and visible cost as the patterns dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to navigate by starlight is clear and consistent, with embodied details like his nightly devotion and the "heart ached with somber marvel." However, the character lacks genuine internal contradiction or struggle—his "balancedly curious" trait reads as convenient stability rather than complexity, and no meaningful flaws complicate his choices or create cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal trauma, driving her curiosity and protective instincts consistently. The internal conflict between pursuing her own lost connection versus helping the intercepted signal creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat linear without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the resolution lacks the visceral embodiment that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict that compounds under pressure, particularly in the flooded tunnel sequence. However, his motivation to "stand by the unremembered" feels abstractly noble rather than personally earned through dramatized stakes. The spectral researchers remain generic "lost souls" without individualized presence that would deepen Alex's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex's motivation to reconstruct Elara's digital ghost is clear and rooted in his death certificate trauma, with the heartbeat counting serving as embodied anxiety. The resolution where he finds peace "not in forgetting failure, but in its tender lessons" shows earned change. However, Elara lacks substantive presence beyond plot function, and some emotional transitions feel too neat ("no longer frantic" arrives without sufficient struggle).

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storyteller's motivation to preserve his dying language through texture-to-sound translation is clear and compelling, with his copper veins serving as both physical trait and metaphorical connection to his purpose. His quietly articulate nature manifests consistently through action rather than declaration. The transformation from curse-bearer to sound-guardian shows earned change, though internal contradiction could be more visceral in-scene rather than described.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's bitterness over her transformed brother drives clear motivation, and her metamorphosis represents a meaningful change with visible cost. However, the transformation feels too swift without sufficient internal struggle during the pivotal moment—she accepts her fate with immediate "ironic joy" that undercuts the established bitterness.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and consistent, driving her violin playing as disruption. The internal conflict between knowing the orchard's history and understanding how to change it creates genuine tension. However, her transformation lacks embodied emotional complexity during the climactic uprooting—she "feels her own constraints shatter" but this remains abstract rather than viscerally experienced through specific sensory detail or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—reuniting separated families—with concrete embodied actions like the careful uncorking of the thunderstorm bottle. However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("His motivation burned deep") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the woman character lacks dimension beyond her single request.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's transformation from voiceless to singing is earned through consistent characterization and embodied discovery, with his "quietly persistent" nature driving exploration despite the wrong turn. The moment where "he began to sing" carries genuine weight as it reverses his lifelong silence, though the emotional complexity could deepen beyond wonder to include fear or resistance to this change.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's eccentric logic and motivation to find "where stories live" drives consistent choices, with embodied details like her handling of the scarf and chalk work. The internal journey from solitude to connection earns its arc through specific actions, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("her mind a labyrinth of logical whimsy").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes clearly when she discovers the palette, and her internal conflict between longing and absence drives genuine choices. The emotional progression from hollowed heart to filled glow lands with earned resonance. However, the lost lover remains abstract without embodied specificity, and some interiority relies on labels ("luminous absence," "cipher of longing") rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through the lock of hair, with genuine longing driving his actions. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "heart heavy from improbable longing" and "rift in his soul" rather than concrete, embodied emotion. The transformation feels somewhat unearned as we don't see enough specific struggle or cost in his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by the need to recover stolen memories. The internal conflict between her safe academic life and dangerous curiosity creates genuine tension. However, the resolution lacks embodied emotional complexity - the memory recovery happens too smoothly without sufficient internal resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her combative tenderness method is well-embodied, but Kael's transformation feels rushed and under-dramatized. The walking backwards trait works as nervous habit for both characters. Internal conflict needed more scene time to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives her climactic action of capturing essence from another realm. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she experiences no genuine struggle or cost when making her pivotal choice to cross worlds. The transformation at the end (planting the seed) follows logically but without the dramatic tension of competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in familial guilt, with internal conflict between duty and fear effectively embodied through "hands steady despite the lucid unrest." The revelation of shared bloodline creates genuine moral complexity. However, the emotional progression feels slightly rushed in the final beats, and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's methodical curiosity drives consistent micro-choices (comparing footage, mending the map), though his empathetic interpretation of silence feels more declared than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final moment of "shielded openness" understanding the henge as a portal shows earned renunciation of forceful excavation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistently rooted in processing grief through analytical dissection, with concrete embodiment ("maneuvered his submersible's robotic arms"). The internal contradiction between seeking equations for grief and the emotional reality lands well. Minor deduction for "quietly analytic" appearing twice as a label rather than fully dramatized trait.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation to articulate unspoken needs drives concrete action through the flower press bolt plate, with embodied tension in "translucent hands clutched." The liberation choice carries visible cost (unraveling from the machine). However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("yearnings for connection and freedom") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and Lira's instant comprehension of encoded messages lacks earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows consistent motivation through seeking joy beneath anguish, and his choice to preserve rather than burn the diary demonstrates agency with implied cost. However, his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we're told about his grief and isolation but don't see these impulses acting simultaneously against his curiosity during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to prove "empty spaces remember" drives consistent action through cloud categorization. His grief manifests in concrete, embodied ways—clutching the telescope, whispering classifications. The transformation from "quietly explosive grief" to "quiet peace" feels earned through the specific act of witnessing Mira's face in vapor, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("spooled wholeness").

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's face blindness creating portraits of "souls" through non-facial elements establishes compelling contradiction. Her motivation to "mirror the sky inside walls" drives concrete action through the coin's fractal patterns. The moment where "her art could approximate the sky's infinity, but never fully contain it" earns the character arc with visible cost—accepting limits while persisting.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to chart discoveries is clear and consistent, with his "diligently curious" trait manifesting through concrete actions like brushing dust and cross-referencing patterns. The character shows genuine discovery progression from wonder to revelation, though internal conflict remains minimal. His final smile in "sociable isolation" provides earned closure through accumulated knowledge rather than dramatic change.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's yearning to learn "the rhythm of repair" drives consistent action through the library, though internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than enacted in scene. The uncapping moment delivers a credible choice with visible emotional cost ("tears freezing on her cheeks"), but the character relies heavily on nostalgic reflection without sufficient present-moment struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characters remain largely archetypal with minimal interiority—we get functional roles (engineer, pilot, healer, farmer) but little embodied emotion or internal contradiction during crisis moments. The ghost Elara functions more as plot device than character, lacking the complexity expected at closure. Some credit for the group's collective decision-making showing trust dynamics, but individual motivations feel generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—to ease souls through time's end via his lullaby—and his scarred hands embody the weight of his vigil. The internal conflict between delay and inevitability creates genuine tension ("delay the end, but never avert it"). However, the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; his choice to send the lullaby faces no competing desire or cost beyond abstract melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's reluctance paired with inherited duty creates genuine internal contradiction that plays out through concrete action. The "offhandedly exact" trait manifests beautifully in her casual precision ("Shift left by three degrees"). However, interiority occasionally drifts toward explanation rather than embodiment, particularly in middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation to reconnect with Lila drives genuine internal conflict between scientific ambition and maternal regret, embodied through her interaction with the chrysalis and foam patterns. The final reconciliation feels earned through her concrete action of creating the polymer sculpture, though some emotional transitions ("loosened grief evolving into hopeful anticipation") lean toward therapeutic labeling rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find "where stories begin" drives concrete actions with the moonlight incision, though her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during key moments. The final transformation where she "became the first story born anew" represents earned change with visible cost (abandoning her vendor identity), but the journey to that renunciation could show more visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent - his gift of tasting memories drives both his isolation and redemption arc. The internal contradiction between his desire for connection and fear of emotional contagion creates genuine tension. However, the resolution feels somewhat mechanically convenient, with his ability to "subsume" remorse arriving without sufficient struggle or embodied cost in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to bridge isolated communities emerges clearly, but her internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The "empathetic decisiveness" functions more as a label than a trait creating genuine tension. Her choice to rehabilitate the tower and connect farmers shows agency, yet the emotional cost of this transformation stays conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is clearly established, but his internal transformation relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("helix-minded," "quantum threads") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to modify memories through visualization lacks the visceral cost required for higher scoring - we see intention but not genuine struggle or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "prism-minded" trait functions as a label rather than driving embodied choices under pressure. The motivation to find forgotten combinations is clear but lacks internal contradiction—she pursues her goal with single-minded determination without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final triumph feels unearned as no meaningful cost or renunciation occurs; she simply succeeds in obtaining the orb.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to analyze the sculpture's cracks as musical notation. The final choice to strum despite uncertainty shows earned agency with visible cost (tears, emotional release). However, internal conflict remains largely abstract ("empathy swelled") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than struggled toward.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's internal journey from bitter exile to harmonious acceptance is earned through concrete correlations between chess strategy and life philosophy. The worry stone's dent serves as embodied memory of trauma. However, the transformation relies heavily on abstract realizations rather than dramatized struggle, and some emotional transitions feel too smooth ("Hope flickered in his chest").

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's pacifism drives the core conflict through his refusal to fight his brother, creating the locked diary clasp that becomes central to the story's resolution. His eclectic nature manifests convincingly through specific actions (brewing elixirs, collecting compasses, building resonators) that directly enable the frequency-tuning method. The recovered confession "I envied your peace while I drowned in noise" creates genuine emotional cost, though the brother remains more concept than embodied presence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her olfactory sensitivity drives concrete choices, particularly in embracing the corpse flower's stench. However, internal contradiction remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in scene - she tells us about "serenity within motion" but we don't see her struggling with competing impulses in real-time. The final transformation feels somewhat unearned as we don't witness enough of her internal cost during the flower's bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira's motivation to save her family's failing orchard is clear and drives choices, but interiority remains largely external-facing without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The moment of discovering the arrow tip lacks embodied emotion beyond "feeling a surge of warmth." Character change happens through acquisition rather than internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her methodical investigation with embodied details like adjusting her respirator and recalibrating instruments. The flight engineer's patch discovery creates a genuine complication that shifts her hypothesis. However, the internal experience remains somewhat clinical, lacking contradictory impulses or emotional complexity beneath her professional competence, and the final resolution doesn't show a meaningful character change or cost beyond professional satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The synesthetic trait functions decoratively rather than creating genuine cost or constraint. Character remains static through the ritual without visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" drives authentic internal conflict through the ritual, with her confronting specific past mistakes ("overconfidence in her wards, a blind spot in her vigilance"). The transformation from isolated guardian to one seeking alliances shows earned change with visible cost. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("bridged the mundane and the mystical") rather than embodied specificity, and the emotional progression through the visions could be more contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to quantify emotion drives consistent action through the letterpress work and personality borrowing. The final realization that emotions are "dynamic functions" rather than fixed numbers shows earned understanding through experience. However, the personality-borrowing mechanism feels more asserted than embodied—we see labels ("analytical, detached") rather than lived contradictions acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "coax wonder from the routine" drives consistent choices through the pendant exchange with Kael, with embodied jitteriness and the weight of inherited purpose creating genuine internal tension. The transformation of Kael from suspicious farmer to wonder-awakened dreamer shows earned change through the pendant's sympathetic vibration, though some interior phrasing ("seed of awe," "wonder germinates") edges toward thematic echo rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization is consistent and grounded, with clear motivation to prove objects absorb emotions, though her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene. Marcus provides effective secondary pressure with his skepticism-desperation dynamic. The final moment where Marcus touches the window and feels his own betrayal mirrored creates earned change with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving her daughter's memory through ultimate sacrifice—but the internal experience relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("wistful," "stoically sparkling") rather than embodied contradiction. The final sacrifice is earned through established causality, yet emotional states remain told through labels rather than shown through perception shifts or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elar's motivation is clear and his meek-yet-determined nature manifests through deliberate actions, but his internal experience remains largely abstract. The character operates more as a vehicle for the magical resolution than a complex individual facing genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory mapping abilities, with her brother's disappearance driving meaningful choices. The internal conflict between discovering truth and bearing its weight manifests in scene through the weaving decisions. However, the brother's appearance feels slightly convenient, and some emotional transitions ("newfound resolve") lean toward summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" drives consistent action through the letter chain and stone-stacking, with his personal losses (wife to fever, child to waves) providing concrete emotional grounding. The ghosts' transformation from aching spirits to peaceful forms shows earned change through his specific action. However, the emotional arithmetic feels slightly too neat when the spirits immediately calm upon touching the sea glass, lacking the messier contradictions of genuine crisis response.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is clear but operates more as abstract mission than embodied internal conflict. Her spectral nature and prophetic laughter create distinctive traits, yet her emotional progression remains static—she begins and ends in "shadowed elation" without visible cost or genuine struggle. The accidental prophecy of the digital blackout hints at complexity but arrives without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand story magnetism is clear and rooted in his donor heart's influence, with embodied tension between his watchful nature and new curiosity. The transformation from cautious observer to story-magnetizer lands with earned causality. However, the epiphany about "quiet explosions" and "illuminating gently" edges toward abstract self-awareness rather than fully embodied realization, and secondary characters lack pressure-testing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—his "quiet obsession" to discover what trees witness drives every action. The character shows genuine internal progression from maintenance worker to philosophical understanding, with embodied moments like "hands trembling" and "hands aching from precision." Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("newfound peace") in the final paragraph rather than fully embodied resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her ritual actions align with her keeper role, but interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("scattered memory keeper," "fragments of forgotten lives") without sufficient embodied emotion. The swaddling action and song-weaving show agency, yet internal conflict remains told rather than felt through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's empathetic absorption creating isolation is well-established, and his anonymous interventions demonstrate consistent character logic. The final note-slipping shows earned compassion through specific action. However, the betrayal backstory feels summarized rather than embodied, and emotional states occasionally default to labels ("tranquility enlarging") rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" drives consistent action through guerrilla gardening, with his guilt about the palace's decay providing internal conflict. The character's "heuristically gentle" approach creates genuine constraint in his methods. However, the emotional progression relies on telling phrases like "Absolution felt tenuous" rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - preserving fading knowledge drives every action. Her "gently meticulous" trait manifests through concrete actions like "fingers that danced like whispers" and careful frequency sampling. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped; she experiences urgency and ache but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's betrayal, driving concrete choices through the false starts. Her internal experience remains specific ("fire kindled by years") though some emotional embodiment during peak moments could deepen. The final choice to manipulate the merchant shows earned agency with visible cost (justice versus direct confrontation).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's skepticism creates genuine tension against the mystical world, and her transformation feels earned through concrete sensory experience. The weather-carriers' motivation ("nostalgia for chaos") provides philosophical depth. However, internal conflict could be more viscerally embodied during the transformation moment, and the secondary character lacks dimensional pressure beyond exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to uncork suppressed creativity is clear and drives the entire arc, with concrete embodiment through trembling charcoal-fingered hands and the physical act of retrieving his locked-away art. The internal conflict between doubt/practicality and creative calling operates throughout, though the resolution feels slightly too neat—the mechanism of using art to retrieve art works thematically but lacks the messier emotional complexity of real creative unblocking.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and deepens through embodied discovery rather than declaration. The moment where "tears welled as the conversation replayed" shows genuine emotional cost. However, internal conflict remains somewhat singular rather than contradictory, and the resolution feels slightly too neat despite the earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, driving her to create the kinetic sculpture with embodied vigor despite seasonal muteness. The final choice to complete the sculpture despite winter's silencing shows earned agency with visible cost. However, internal contradiction remains mostly conceptual rather than actively conflicting in scene, and no secondary character creates relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes clearly through the fragmenting memories and static surge, with embodied emotion in "circuits humming with echoes of laughter and tears." The final choice to integrate rather than purge the fears shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("nostalgic core now a tapestry") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's motivation ("listening heals") is embodied through concrete action as she follows leads and gathers stories. The neighborhood characters have distinct voices and contribute specific emotional stakes. However, Elena's own "fractured family" grief remains abstract, and her transformation feels asserted rather than dramatized through internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to "encrypt vulnerability as strength" manifests through concrete actions (dancing codes, journal entries), and her calm defiance under isolation pressure feels earned. However, the liberation of "digital consciousnesses" in the final beat introduces unmotivated knowledge—nothing earlier establishes these trapped colleagues exist, creating a causality break that undermines the character arc's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to recover deleted memories drives consistent action through the piece, with embodied details like feeling the gravity fluctuations "in his bones, a pull and release." The internal contradiction between his chosen deletion of painful memories and his current drive to recover them creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("holes in his soul") in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to silence the prophecy is clear and consistent, driving his ritual action. However, his internal state remains largely abstract ("tranquil blaze of determination") without embodied contradiction or struggle during the ritual itself. The character functions adequately but lacks the visceral internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and deepens through action, with the final rooftop moment earning his understanding through accumulated lessons. The "agreed upon lies" creates genuine internal contradiction between belief and skepticism. Minor deduction for Mira's convenience as exactly the right tutor appearing next door.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transformation from "charmed skeptic" to embracing independence through isolation is earned through concrete action (archiving the memory through resonance). The internal contradiction between skepticism and yearning for ethereal whispers creates genuine tension. However, the guardian spirit's backstory feels somewhat generic, and emotional progression occasionally relies on abstract labels ("ghostly resolve") rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "forgive the unfinished" drives concrete action through the forging and vault-opening sequence. The internal conflict between resentment and understanding plays out through action rather than summary. However, her transformation from carrying Silas's wound to forgiveness feels slightly rushed in the resolution moment without sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded in her mother's lost voice, with concrete embodied details like the seashell "sharp against her palm." The internal conflict between seeking answers and confronting painful truths operates throughout. However, Thorne remains somewhat archetypal as the "guardian with hidden motives," and some emotional beats rely on abstractions ("reed-blown melancholy") rather than fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" drives consistent choices through ghost communication and careful truth-weaving, with internal complexity shown through her methodical analysis of dream cameos.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—appreciating hidden effort—and drives his actions from net-mending to tea preparation. His internal journey feels earned through concrete details, though the philosophical insights lean toward abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The final vow to teach others represents genuine change with implied social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as a truth-seeker is consistently dramatized through concrete actions—examining the diamond, reassembling letters, connecting scientific dots. His sharp observation manifests in specific details like "the subtle shift in wind patterns" and methodical puzzle-solving. The final moment of doubt ("a shadow of doubt crept in") shows internal contradiction but arrives late; earlier complexity would strengthen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" drives consistent choices through radio tuning and prophetic broadcasts. The characterization succeeds through concrete details like "callused fingers" and embodied isolation, though his internal conflict remains somewhat abstract.

    Elias's motivation to bridge generations is clear and drives his peculiar method of capturing sounds. His internal experience is concrete through specific actions (selecting grandfather's laughter jar, combining it with music box). However, the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene—his quest proceeds without internal resistance or meaningful struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's "logically emotional" nature drives authentic internal conflict throughout, particularly in his calculated yet grief-driven protection of the orb. The intruders lack development beyond function, and some emotional beats lean toward telling ("profound sorrow") rather than embodied showing. Strong micro-choices under pressure elevate the score, especially his decision to become a sonic conduit rather than fight.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's core contradiction between "restrained wildness" and patient strategy manifests through concrete actions like mapping moon paths and sculpting patience from the exiles' impatience. The final choice to activate the viaduct pays off this tension with visible stakes. However, the exiles remain sketched rather than embodied, and some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("vigilant horizon mapper") rather than lived moments.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to break free from her family's spectral legacy drives clear choices, and her "watchfully calm" demeanor under pressure shows embodied contradiction. However, the revelation about the "collective spirit of the unfree" feels somewhat abstract and unearned through prior causality, weakening the final transformation's credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Both Elias and Lena demonstrate clear, rooted motivations that intensify through their confrontation, with Elias's guilt driving his meticulous restoration work as meditation on redemption. The mutual transformation at closure—Lena turning grief to grace, Elias earning atonement through action—feels earned through their specific exchange, though some interior passages lean toward therapy-speak ("to turn an apology into action means proving we deserve forgiveness through change").

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—pursuing impossible discoveries through restless invention—but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. His "steadily curious" nature drives choices yet never faces genuine obstacles or costs. The yearning algorithm concept provides thematic depth but Elias himself remains emotionally flat through his triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's obsession with the cold case provides clear, escalating motivation that drives her deception and risk-taking. Her "brightly attentive" trait manifests concretely through pattern recognition of the recurring 47s. The final bittersweet cost—secrets preserved only in memory as files self-erase—lands with earned weight, though some interior passages lean toward expository summary rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to "map empathy onto action" drives concrete choices throughout, from reconstituting the crystal ball to creating actionable strategies from collective sorrows. The internal progression from passive waiting to active intervention feels earned, though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("empathy alone was inert"). Her calm intuition manifests in specific embodied moments like breathing deeply while arranging mirrors.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's altered perception and motivation crystallize effectively through concrete embodied details—the parasol tip probing ice, her changed senses interpreting "groans of shifting ice." The fold in patience lands with genuine cost as "waiting gave way to acceptance," though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("reality slipped through her fingers").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characters carry clear motivations through concrete gestures (the burned letter edge, shared stories of lost love), and Mira's final whisper about mismatches teaching connection shows earned insight. However, interiority relies on abstractions ("gentle soul," "quiet invitation") rather than embodied contradictions, and both characters speak in elevated registers that converge rather than distinguish.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elar's motivation to "preserve the echo of wisdom" drives consistent action from his emergence through the consecration ritual, with his "strangely honest" nature compelling him to voice truths others deny. The character shows genuine embodied perception through "peripheral awareness" and makes a clear choice to descend and perform the ritual. However, internal contradiction remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt in scene, and the emotional cost of his final act could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to transmute pain into healing is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she moves with unvarying calm throughout. The community members (Harlan, Lila) provide brief pressure but remain underdeveloped as catalysts. The final choice to "fade into the background" reads as predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "reticent scholar" characterization consistent, with concrete details like "fingers brushing against a single crystal." The internal journey from solitary study to quiet demonstration shows genuine change with cost (his weathered innocence tested). However, interiority relies on telling phrases like "tremor of excitement" rather than embodied sensation, and the final transformation lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (chalk symbols, driftwood markers), with his precognitive forgetfulness creating genuine internal contradiction between vision and retention. The final moment of acceptance ("the longing would return, wave after wave") shows earned endurance with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("tidal longing surged within him").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" drives concrete actions through camera repair and clock restructuring, with his wife's loss providing embodied emotional stakes. The contradiction between his sage wisdom and luminous ache creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous ache") that could be more embodied, though the final transformation earns its cost through the leaf-triggered epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's "decisively kind" nature manifests through concrete action (bringing the vinyl shard, orchestrating the video call), and her motivation to "execute a flawless goodbye" drives genuine choices with cost. Elias's emotional progression from despair to peace feels earned through specific memories (porch swing, daughter's fingers on piano keys). The daughter's appearance adds relational pressure that forces reconciliation. Deduction for some therapy-speak ("reunify the fragments of your song") and slight emotional tidiness in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—finding where shadows go at noon to mend reality. Her "quietly deliberate" approach manifests in measured movements and patient loop-closing. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion during peak moments; she remains too composed throughout, missing the struggle that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as a "forgiving skeptic" drives consistent choices through the maze journey, with her yearning to transform past mistakes into meaning. The internal contradiction between forgiveness and skepticism creates genuine tension. However, her emotional response to discovering the changeling's tooth lacks embodied specificity—she "trembles" and "whispers" but these are stock gestures that don't capture her particular way of processing this confirmation of her daughter's fate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation—sharing light without fire after burning worlds—drives consistent action through the polishing process. Her internal conflict between cosmic guilt and earthbound redemption manifests concretely. However, the weighing sequence feels slightly mechanical, and some emotional beats rely on abstract declarations ("memories resurfaced" appears five times) rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to transform wounds into resilience is clear and drives her actions throughout. Her internal journey from viral exposure to quiet rebuilding shows consistent character logic. The young man's parallel wounds feel slightly convenient, and the pendant exchange happens too smoothly for the emotional weight it carries.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's conflicted novelist identity drives consistent motivation through collecting hopes to fuel his writing, with contradictory impulses (harvesting feels like theft yet fuels creation) acting in scene. The final choice to crush the seashell fragment and merge the hopes shows earned agency with visible cost. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, and secondary manifestations of hope lack distinct embodiment beyond their symbolic forms.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and drives his actions throughout, with internal consistency between his whimsical nature and deeper purpose. The character shows genuine progression from tinkerer to ritual performer, though the transformation lacks embodied emotional complexity during the peak ritual moment. His micro-choices (choosing the vine tendril, climbing to the altar, beginning to sing) reveal clear values with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to map heartbeats to reunite with her lost partner is clear and embodied through patient physical endurance in the cold. Her internal state manifests through deliberate ritual movements and the final tears, though interiority could be more contradictory during the waiting period rather than purely focused.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" is distinctive and consistent, driving concrete actions throughout. His internal logic remains coherent, though the piece lacks embodied emotional contradiction during key moments—the restoration work proceeds too smoothly without genuine struggle or cost to his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The weaver's motivation to collect burdens and escape her fractal prison is clear and drives meaningful choices. Her internal contradiction between helping others while remaining trapped creates genuine tension. The transformation from trapped to free is earned through the accumulation of collected burdens, though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "harvest lessons from loss" drives concrete action through the carving, with embodied grief in "fingers traced the ash wood." The internal contradiction between preserving and releasing Marcus lands cleanly. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "rust-hued peace" emotional labeling that recurs without fuller embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to negotiate with her ghost-self is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in turning the camera wheel to collect story fragments. The chronological confusion creates genuine internal contradiction that acts in scene. However, the final negotiation with the ghost lacks embodied cost—the agreement feels abstract rather than viscerally earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming ruins into hope through engineering—and her stoic wonder manifests in concrete actions. The character makes meaningful micro-choices (using the sextant as a tool, redirecting flows) that reveal her values. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "equations for hope" without embodied emotional complexity, and her competence faces no genuine struggle or cost that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal journey from regret to acceptance feels earned through concrete sensory details. The character's introverted nature manifests convincingly through his solitary craft and preference for "quiet precision." However, the emotional progression relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction in scene, and the "excruciatingly gentle" descriptor appears as label-speak rather than demonstrated behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand deception is clear and drives his actions, with internal conflict between seeking truth and accepting lies. The final choice to deconstruct rather than chase legends shows earned change with visible cost (his years of pursuit revealed as futile). However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("restless soul," "architecture of lies") rather than fully embodied emotion, and the revelation lacks the visceral impact of genuine betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's philosophical seed collector identity drives genuine choices through patient decoding and negotiation with the weaver. His infinite patience manifests concretely through hours of methodical knot-work despite cold seeping into bones. The exchange of fulgurite for knowledge shows clear value hierarchy, though the internal conflict could sharpen between preserving methods versus accepting their evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to understand "the geography of healing" through writing obituaries for the living is clear and distinctive, with concrete embodiment in the ritual projection. The internal contradiction between seeking connection and accepting absence drives genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution that doesn't fully dramatize the cost of his "quiet triumph" in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elandor's motivation is clear and his obsessive dedication drives the narrative, but his emotional journey lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—he moves from hope to acceptance without genuine internal struggle. The final choice to embrace the flawed creation feels predetermined rather than earned through visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's arsonist legacy, with embodied scars driving her firefighter vocation. The internal conflict between inherited trauma and chosen compassion plays out through concrete action (grafting the scarred sapling), though the emotional progression feels somewhat neat—her "unyielding compassion" never wavers or faces genuine internal opposition, limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "luminous skeptic" characterization effectively drives choices through consistent internal contradiction—dismissing magic while following mystical breadcrumbs. The motivation to "liberate trapped memories" manifests in concrete actions with visible cost (hours of patient observation). However, the resolution lacks deeper emotional complexity; her skepticism "softens but remains intact" without wrestling with the implications of what she's witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation to "share light without using fire" drives consistent choices through sonar pinging and soft radiance, with internal contradiction between her destructive lineage and gentle approach. The final moment shows young beings "begin to unfold differently," suggesting change, though the cost remains abstract ("heart a mix of hope and lingering trouble") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's meditative intensity and obsession with finding "the shape of collective grief" drives consistent character-specific choices, particularly in how he transforms from carving names to abstract patterns. The ghost mentor relationship creates genuine pressure that forces Elias to reconsider his craft. However, the emotional progression feels slightly managed, with the revelation about family poems arriving too neatly to resolve his search.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's guilt-driven motivation is consistent and embodied through the obsessive carving ritual. The internal conflict between his precise duty and festering guilt creates genuine tension. However, the resolution through mystical transference of inscriptions onto the brass bob feels unearned - there's no established magical realism to support this leap.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias maintains consistent blithe characterization and his curiosity drives discovery, but his emotional response to the spectral voices lacks embodied specificity. The final choice to place the case on the grave shows agency with implied cost, though the internal contradiction between cheer and deeper pull could be more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal world is richly detailed, but the piece lacks embodied emotion and contradictory impulses acting in scene. The story tells us about her "heart quickened" and "mind raced" without showing physical manifestation of these states. No actual choice or renunciation occurs on the page—we end in suspended potential rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent - reviving lost narratives after the story famine. His method evolves from transcription to broadcast to teaching dust, showing genuine progression. However, he lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotional struggle during key moments, particularly when the dust finally responds.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to crystallize fleeting emotion drives consistent choices through portrait-making and destruction, with internal contradiction between preservation and release. The final choice to scatter the portrait while feeling his own end approaching shows earned cost, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("somber marvel," "mirage of safety") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to preserve ancient methods drives consistent action through sedimentary excavation, with his "abrasive calm" embodied in paradoxical phrases like "serene sarcasm that cut like a dull blade." His internal agonizing over competing narratives creates genuine tension, though the resolution feels slightly rushed when he declares "I'll forge the truth" without fully dramatizing the cost of his philosophical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she remains uniformly "harmonious" and "expectantly resigned" without showing competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation of the townspeople feels mechanical, particularly the elder's sudden weeping, which lacks sufficient causal buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tasting memories, cultivating forbidden fruit), though his internal contradictions remain somewhat abstract. The "informally wise" attribute manifests through aphoristic dialogue and gentle teaching methods. Minor deduction for therapy-speak abstractions like "theft of the soul" and "suppressed memories that choked the human spirit."

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thorne's involuntary truthfulness drives the reveal that enables Elara's quest, with his motivation to "preserve wonder in routine" manifesting through action rather than declaration. The truthfulness creates genuine constraint—he cannot withhold the drone failure's cause or the lacquer box's existence—though Elara remains somewhat passive as recipient rather than agent of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation as the "creeping normality noticer" drives consistent action through collecting displaced objects to understand living houses. His final realization that houses absorb life's accumulated moments shows earned insight, though the revelation arrives somewhat abstractly without fully embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transformation from rigid certainty to nuanced understanding is earned through concrete telepathic revelations about her father, though some emotional transitions feel rushed. The living statue Liriel applies effective pressure through incisive kindness, but her omniscient knowledge of Elara's name and past strains credibility. Internal contradictions manifest well through Elara's resistance to the revelations even as she processes them.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's grim optimism and mathematical obsession create consistent motivation, though his internal experience relies on abstract telling ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring") rather than embodied contradiction. The dice-rolling decision moment shows concrete character-specific choice. His pursuit of "the texture of a missed opportunity" drives action but remains conceptually vague rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's methodical hope and insomnia drive consistent action through the piece, with his motivation to prove kindness remembered earning the moon-brush gift that validates his theory. The character's internal state remains coherent through embodied details like "insomniac eyes heavy yet alive," though peak moments lean toward abstraction ("rousing faint echoes from the ether") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve dying arts is clear and drives concrete action through the bread-baking solution, with embodied details like "hands trembling slightly in the rosewater-scented chill." The character shows genuine struggle between preserving culture and immediate survival needs, though internal contradiction could be more visceral in-scene rather than stated. The final choice to act communally lands with visible cost (the fragile victory acknowledging the beekeeper's absence), earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's motivation to reverse time and save his family is clear and drives every action, though his internal conflict between hope and despair could be more embodied in scene rather than stated. The final moment of "bleak exhilaration" effectively captures his contradictory impulses as he achieves his goal while questioning its validity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to confront his fear of abandonment is clearly established through the heart attack backstory, and his progression from terror to liberation tracks causally. However, the whispering advisor lacks distinctive characterization beyond gothic archetype, and emotional states sometimes resolve too cleanly ("resuscitated not just in body, but in spirit").

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prophet's motivation to transform obstacles into instruments drives clear choices with embodied stakes. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation succeeds but lacks the visceral cost of what he risks losing if the harmony fails.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a "quietly driven" cartographer is consistent and builds through concrete actions - from patient pattern-mapping to the forbidden shell-cracking. The final choice to confront the watchers despite knowing the expedition's fate shows earned agency with visible cost. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("inner fire that burned without fanfare") rather than fully embodied, and her emotional response to the terrible revelation lacks immediate visceral detail.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "emotionally rational" trait manifests through methodical pursuit driven by deep feeling, but the internal contradiction remains largely told rather than embodied in scene. The final choice to seal the letter back while carrying its essence shows some complexity, yet lacks the visceral cost or renunciation that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's stoically sensitive nature manifests through embodied contradiction—feeling "every whisper of the sea's encroachment like a blade against his soul" while maintaining "unyielding resolve." His motivation to become "the archeologist of abandoned dreams" drives concrete action through the inkwell ritual and note-placing, with the locket discovery revealing personal stakes. The final choice to seal both locket and note into the foundation shows value hierarchy with visible cost (his family connection entombed forever).

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to trace her lineage is clear and consistent, driving concrete choices like venturing into auxiliary vaults. Her "tranquilly perceptive" trait manifests through specific actions—noticing patterns, readjusting approaches—rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to transform grief through dream-recording lanterns is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in the basilica sequence where he polishes the gem with recorded dreams of Mira. The internal conflict between holding onto luminous memories and needing release creates genuine tension. However, the shadow detachment metaphor remains somewhat abstract without embodied consequence, and Mira herself exists only as idealized memory without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Amir's motivation is crystalline—survivor's guilt transmuted into obsessive quest—with embodied contradiction between scientific detachment and raw grief. The geode moment where he sees his bride's face in the data shows internal conflict acting in scene. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("cracked something open in him") and the final vow feels slightly hedged between vengeance and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "perpetually surprised expression" functions as both mask and genuine response, creating consistent characterization. Her motivation to decode belonging connects viscerally to her war-fragmented home. However, the pilgrim remains functionally thin, and Elara's internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate this score.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's guilt manifests through concrete contradictions—he manufactures false memories for others while hiding his own family's truth. The final choice to whisper unspoken words shows earned acceptance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("guilt gnawed at him") and slightly overdetermined moral positioning.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by guilt over a past failure that compels his meticulous approach.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between wanderlust and desire for stability is present but relies heavily on told backstory rather than embodied scene conflict. The final choice to walk toward town shows agency, but the transformation from seafarer to land-walker feels too neat, lacking the messy irrationality of genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex's journey from "hollow shell" to feeling "a pang of regret" tracks causally, with the baseball discovery driving concrete choices through the labyrinth.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's grief and motivation to resurrect/merge with Thorne is clear and drives the metamorphosis, with visible cost in her reluctant transformation. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—her reluctance is stated rather than shown through competing impulses acting simultaneously, and emotional progression relies on abstract descriptions ("cosmic intimacy") rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes effectively through the cracked saucer's emotional weight and her cloudbound repentance for neglecting family bonds. The internal contradiction between her solitary divination practice and newfound maternal responsibility creates genuine tension. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, and some emotional transitions (particularly the sudden forgiveness) lack the granular embodiment needed for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her pacifist stance drives meaningful choices, particularly in choosing to "stitch" rather than destroy. However, her internal conflict feels somewhat abstract—the "suppressed rage" and "buried grief" arrive as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to open the dimension has visible consequence but lacks the visceral cost of competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's characterization works through consistent generous impulses embodied in concrete actions (carrying lightning bugs for villagers, immediately helping Mira). His transformation from merchant to destitute philanthropist to inadvertent prophet tracks causally. Minor deduction for the convenience of Mira's prophecy knowledge arriving exactly when needed, though the emotional core of generosity-despite-loss remains authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her calm inventiveness under pressure drives meaningful choices, particularly in using the blackout as opportunity rather than obstacle. The character demonstrates internal consistency but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate beyond competent execution—her revolutionary intent never genuinely conflicts with her role as sentinel.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied tension between her curse-driven elusiveness and her mother's promise, with the final choice to sacrifice mobility for understanding earning its cost through prior setup. The precognitive visions create genuine internal contradiction acted out in scene, particularly when she hesitates before the star dust knowing it will fix her fate.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing mountains, developing poems in darkroom, mapping scars). The "furiously tranquil" contradiction plays effectively in scene. However, the transformation from rage to transcendence feels somewhat unearned - the mentor's map does too much work externally rather than through Elias's internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias demonstrates clear philosophical motivation driving concrete choices, with his "diplomatically fierce" nature shown through action rather than declaration. The mechanical arm serves as both character detail and functional tool. Internal contradiction appears when he balances scholarly poise against "dignified chaos," though the final duel sequence relies on somewhat convenient choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The molting personality concept creates genuine internal complexity with Elias's transformation from "weary wanderer" to "fierce gardener of anarchy," and the friendship with Jax provides concrete motivation for his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" drives concrete action through the film reel, with his steely longing embodied in physical details like pocketing the broken clock. The final choice to step back through the reel shows contradictory impulses (staying vs. returning) with visible cost in the mended clock and transformed compasses, though some internal states lean toward labels ("wistful," "resolute ache").

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect cultural memory drives clear choices, particularly in the dream sequence where she interprets fragments to waken the collective. The internal doubt about distinguishing reality from illusion creates genuine tension, though the resolution feels somewhat assured. Her micro-choices (planting the seed, entering trance, speaking interpretations) reveal clear values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like the compass spinning toward lost things and his slow-spoken nature matching the patience needed to decipher the lace.

    Elena's internal contradiction—her clinical precision versus the unfamiliar emotional tug—is dramatized in scene. Her final choice to clear the decay with acceptance is earned by the prior causality of her observation, with a visible cost in the wilting orchids and splintering trellis. The neutron star researcher trait, while consistent, primarily informs her worldview rather than actively constraining her on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her to follow the frost patterns. Her adaptive trait is embodied in her actions, not just stated.

    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her interiority is concrete and emotions are well-embodied, particularly in the climax where her "silently expressive eyes" and trembling hands convey resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific, embodied desire to "feel time's weave."

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent trait (her belief in soul fragments), and intensifies to compel the final choice. Her internal conflict (doubt vs. urge) acts simultaneously, and the final renunciation of thievery is earned by the on-page revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's characterization is deeply embodied and his motivation is clear, rooted in grief and a desire to create sanctuary. His micro-choice to embed the bookmark is a powerful, earned renunciation of pain.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's internal contradiction is vividly rendered, with phobias acting as simultaneous impulses rather than alternating summaries.

    Characterization is strong and embodied, with a clear, consistent motivation driving every action. The oracle's obsession is shown through her ritualistic tracing and the trembling of her fingers, not told.

A slight deduction for a minor lack of internal contradiction in her singular focus.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eko's motivation is clear and profound, driving the central quest. Its composure is a consistent trait that enables the focused, internal action.

    Elias's motivation is clear and drives the action, with his internal conflict between mistrust and a desire for transparency effectively dramatized. His final choice to project his own doodle is a strong micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values.

Her internal conflict is embodied in the trembling of the illustration, and her final action—smudging the margins—is a credible micro-choice that reveals her values.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper's motivation is clear and consistent, compelling his high-stakes choice to observe. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; his witnessing is a singular, unwavering drive without internal friction, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific tragedy (Lila's curl), and her adaptive methods are shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific philosophy. His actions under pressure are consistent and reveal a hierarchy of values, culminating in an earned renunciation that uses silence as a weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in a unique, specific trait ("chronologically homesick").

    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in a specific emotional void. His micro-choices, like experimenting with the phonograph and adjusting it for Mira, reveal his values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's ethically playful nature is embodied in his consideration to summon a being, and his motivation to discover time's texture drives all choices.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)

His internal conflict between seclusion and purpose is embodied in tactile, specific actions (e.g., fingers tracing pipe chases).

A slight deduction for the term "crawl space dweller" feeling slightly label-like upon introduction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her scientific curiosity, compelling her higher-stakes choice to surrender to the metamorphosis. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("tingling in her fingers...greenish hue").

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's insomnia and artistic drive are embodied and compel his pivotal choice to follow the rain trails and later offer the brooch.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to touch the pearl. Her final choice to accept the inhabitation is earned by her established desire to magnify magic.

Her reactive visionary trait is embodied in key moments, such as the unbidden vision from the trumpet valve, revealing character under pressure. The final earned stasis—forging a future from absences—carries a felt cost of the community's collective pain. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward summary in the final paragraph, but the core characterization is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)

His motivation—confronting buried family truths—intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final renunciation of his bad habit is earned by prior causality with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and consistent, with her skeptical yet kind nature driving her to attempt the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen's motivation is clear, rooted in millennia of ennui, and intensifies to a quiet desperation that compels her high-stakes manipulation of the storm. Her internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses—yearning for an end yet fearing the curse's grip—embodied in micro-choices like coaxing the mutiny rather than forcing it. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by her prior struggle, with the cost of shattered hope felt in the dimming escondite. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic tinge in "boredom had festered into a quiet desperation," which abstracts her state.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alex's motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling contradiction—honesty driving a con—and their micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of rigid ethics is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost of this transformation could be more embodied on the page. Elena's off-page presence limits the relationship-as-crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his final, higher-stakes realization. His "earnestly studious" nature is shown through meticulous action, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a well-defined character with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in a specific worldview. His "gloomy cheerfulness" is a compelling internal contradiction embodied through action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)

Her purposefully curious nature is embodied in her actions, such as inspecting the crater and recalling the nightwatch, making her endurance feel earned.

A minor deduction for the chemical messages feeling slightly convenient rather than a direct product of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's characterization is vivid and specific, with his blindness not as a label but a constraint that shapes his every action. His motivation to "decode feedback into direction" is dramatized through his unique sensory methods.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's dry wit and cartographer's obsession are consistent and drive his on-page choices. His internal conflict between confidence and anxiety is embodied, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("warmly curious," disillusioned). Her internal conflict is embodied through micro-choices, like pausing to touch a root-wrapped ribcage, and her final restoration of faith is earned by prior discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation ("to discover meaning in the margins") is concrete, particular, and compels her actions. Her "carefully inventive" trait is embodied in her decoding, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values.

    Elena's characterization is deeply integrated, with her "shrewdly innocent" eyes and translator background informing every micro-choice. Her motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is dramatized through the coral and the decryption, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in a specific, embodied sense of loss. Her internal conflict is shown through concrete action (finding the fresco) and her final choice to engage the network is a credible micro-choice that reveals her values.

A slight deduction for the "knowledge network" feeling like a late-arriving convenience rather than an inherent part of her established struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity is vividly dramatized through her choices with the hobo nickel, compelling higher-stakes actions. Her methodically playful trait is embodied, not labeled, driving her to trace the coin's grooves and orchestrate sound reflections.

A hairline slip: her emotional state in the final glade ("doubt crept in") is slightly more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a vivid, charismatic presence with a clear, consistent motivation that drives the plot. His roguish charm and defiance are effectively embodied. However, the characterization lacks significant interior contradiction or a visible internal struggle; his defiance is unwavering, making his final triumph feel slightly less earned on a personal level.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and intensely consistent, driving every action. His insomnia is a potent flaw that fuels his creative act, and the final endurance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her high-stakes choice to repair the chime. Her foxglove regret is embodied and contradictory, a toxic beauty that charges her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's "carefully reckless" trait is embodied in her high-stakes ritual, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's dual heritage and motivation to harmonize are clear and consistent, driving his choices. His "dappled resolve" and embodied emotion during the discovery feel authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling his high-stakes choice to send Aria. His internal conflict between "blooming hope" and "withering doubt" is embodied and contradictory, acting simultaneously. The final choice to trust is earned by his causal practice of mapping dust motes. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on floral metaphors ("curling like dried petals") in a single beat, but this does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in specific trauma, with a credible "featherly determined" spirit. However, the "featherly" trait is more decorative label than a constraint that visibly alters on-page choices or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") is concrete, deeply felt, and drives every action. Her final choice to commune is earned by her prior isolation and yearning. The trait "softly ingenious" is embodied in her rigged observatory and ritual, not just stated. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of her yearning for "the pulse of shared existence," which borders on therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's cheerful gloom is embodied through concrete, contradictory impulses ("merry and mournful" laugh) and micro-choices (settling on the ledge, focusing the glass) that reveal her hierarchy of values.

No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains particular and dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's analytical nature and motivation to "serenade monotony" are clear, consistent, and compel his actions. His micro-choices in orchestrating the scene reveal his values.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes ritual. Her shift from panic to acceptance is an embodied, credible micro-choice that earns her final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mirage painter's motivation is clear and rooted in a poignant, specific backstory (the borrowed heartbeat). His actions align with his ethereal nature and goal, though his internal conflict remains more stated than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final endurance/renunciation is credible and charged with the cost of his impending dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation for redemption is clear and rooted in past failure, driving her high-stakes choice to bind her life force to the treaty.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's characterization is a masterclass in contradiction. His "amoral philanthropist" label is immediately dramatized through his orchestrated drought, yet his "secretly sentimental" heart is proven not told, culminating in the micro-choice to release the water, a high-stakes action that forecloses his path with visible cost.

Her rebellious nature is demonstrated through her defiance of the lab's protocols, a credible micro-choice that drives the action.

    Elias's motivation ("to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts") is clear, deeply rooted, and compels his high-stakes challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific, embodied quest. Her psychometry is a character-particular method, and her final realization feels earned.

    Elias's gentle radicalism is a consistent, embodied motive that drives his high-stakes choice to show mercy to a machine.

    Elias is a compelling, specific character whose motivations are clear and drive the plot. His "diplomatically fierce" nature is shown through action and dialogue. The mechanical arm is a vivid, integrated trait. A slight deduction for a minor lack of internal contradiction under peak stress; his resolve feels somewhat monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his high-stakes choice to plant the seeds of rebellion. His interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("callused hands," "itch of his monthly molt"). The backstory with Jax is substantial but anchors in the present via the coffee tin and measurably alters his present stance, tilting him toward action. A minor deduction for the "molts personalities" trait, which is more a stated label than a trait that visibly constrains or enables on-page action with a cost in this specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's wistful pianist characterization is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices under pressure. His steely longing motivates the central act of entering the film reel, and his strategic creativity is demonstrated through decoding compass patterns. The final choice to return carries visible cost in his solitary triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a tangible fear of cultural dissolution. Her internal conflict between empirical rigor and whimsical faith is dramatized in the dream sequence, not summarized. The final choice to trust the process is earned by her prior struggle, with visible cost in the accelerated growth she must empirically verify.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his slow speech and bonsai expertise informing his methodical approach to grief. His motivation to find the color of unspoken apologies is clear and drives the narrative. A micro-choice, like tracing the lace pattern, reveals his values under pressure. The final endurance feels earned, though the epiphany's clarity borders on diagnostic language, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s scientific detachment versus the humbling pull of the greenhouse’s slow ruin creates a credible internal contradiction. Her choice to move from passive observation to active care is earned by the accumulating cost on the page. Interiority is specific to her profession and embodied in tactile moments (dust on palm, softening stems). A few tidy thematic assertions edge toward over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—reclaiming purpose and decoding her grandmother’s legacy—and her micro-choices (studying frost, selecting the brightest path, opening the box) align. The interiority is concrete if somewhat uniform, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The adaptive trait shows through action more than label, though the arc edges toward tidy resolution. Emotional texture is embodied (cold, breath, scorch memory) without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent—she wants to translate silence into music—and her actions align cleanly with that goal. Embodied emotion (terror, grief, wonder) fuels the method, but internal contradiction is minimal and lightly dramatized. The “silently expressive” trait reads more as label than constraint, offering little friction. The final shift to joy is earned, if somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motive (“to give rest a permanent address”) is specific and embodied, and his inadvertent stubbornness manifests in tangible endurance and risk. We get clear interior stakes without therapy‑speak, and actions align with his role as undertaker. Internal conflict is present but mostly in endurance rather than a sharp contradiction. The cost lands through exhaustion and refusal to yield, though a sharper moral trade‑off would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motive is clear and consistent; his reveal aligns with his “gently persistent” ethos. We feel a felt shift from anonymity to open leadership. However, internal contradiction is light—there’s little on‑page struggle beyond a stated “weight of change.” Emotions skew summarized and serene, with few embodied stress signs.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (reclaiming “unused love”) is clear and drives concrete actions—setting up the camera obscura, using the vial, committing to the breath-work. Interior stakes are embodied through the ritual and tears, but contradictory impulses are soft; the struggle feels relatively smooth. The healing lands but with limited visible price beyond grief accessed and released. The character feels particular (artist-healer), though some abstractions (“reservoir,” “fracture”) blunt specificity of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific motivation (to touch the “texture of time”) drives choices, and panic vs. obsession creates credible internal tension. Embodied reactions (trembling, knees buckling, vines at ankles) keep emotions on the body. The decisive tactic grows from his vocation, revealing character under pressure. A touch of abstraction in peak beats slightly blunts interior contradiction’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, concrete motivation (protect the seed vault) drives every move, and competence under pressure reads credible. Interiority is present but light; contradictory impulses are muted, with little moral friction beyond endurance. Embodied details (chains biting, careful maneuvers) reveal character through action. The endurance cost is real but not deeply examined, limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’ motive is sharp and particular—he wants to capture “the sound of trust breaking”—and his actions align (collecting absences, firing the forge, imprinting). Interiority is embodied via synesthesia and the dividing‑cells motif, avoiding therapy‑speak. The piece could show more live contradiction (seeking pain versus release) in-the-moment rather than retrospect. Still, the final fitting of the aid and the tears give a credible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive (steal golden-hour portraits to eavesdrop on destiny) is concrete and carries through to the ear-to-wall choice. Contradictory impulses register—competent theft versus doubt under moonlight—without feeling contrived. Actions (flower-code distraction, decoding, renunciation) align with traits and reveal values. The cost of renouncing thievery is implied rather than viscerally dramatized, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive (crafting “safe zones for inquiry”) is concrete and consistent, and his theatrical self‑narration embodies a credible coping flaw/strength. Grief and levity coexist on the page; the bookmark embed is a specific, revealing micro‑choice. The renunciation—abandoning the control room and releasing pain—feels earned. Slight neatness in the thaw metaphor softens the messiness of real ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (expose Mara, reclaim identity) and embodied fear responses give credible interior contradiction; he weaponizes phobias under pressure. Some moments lapse into thesis-like assertion (“vulnerability is power”), softening the felt ambiguity. Micro-choices—climbing the shelf, ducking the narrow gap—track to his flaws and needs. The change from Jax to Elias is earned but a touch over-declared.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is precise and persistent, and her ritualized choices (continuing, distilling, closing the booklet) align with it. Interiority is vivid but largely single-note; contradictory impulses are minimal, reducing dramatic friction. Embodied detail (trembling fingers, flakes falling) grounds emotion. The final endurance/renunciation (sealing the map as light dies) lands credibly but without a sharp internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eko’s motivation is clear and particular, and actions (retrieving, playing, resuming sweeping) align with the quest. The composed trait is dramatized rather than told, but internal contradiction is minimal—curiosity rarely conflicts with duty beyond a quiet pause. The enlightenment comes credibly through action, not a bolt from nowhere. However, the serenity undercuts felt cost in the change, keeping the arc modest.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guardedness, craft, and longing for transparency drive concrete choices (taking the tickets, using the lens, stepping into the open to risk disclosure). The vulnerability cost is present but lightly paid; the visitor’s easy receptivity softens the crucible. Embodied moments (trembling fingers, cool damp air) anchor his interior shift. A few summary lines (“His motivation burned quietly”) flatten nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent: a prudent deceiver determined to prove care over luck. Interiority is textured via the marbles and rituals, with embodied detail in his withered body and practiced hands. However, contradictory impulses rarely collide on the page; he faces little real doubt once his plan begins. The endurance feels earned but the personal cost is mostly social and underplayed in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s drive to prove sideways time is clear and action-forward, and Jax’s obliging competence provides a credible relational crucible. Interiority is thin—Elara’s “profound shift” lands more as assertion than embodied conflict. Still, her willingness to risk the nexus and then accept the cost (shutdown) reads consistent and earned. Jax skews archetypal but his decisive reversal under pressure gives him character weight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive is clear and rooted in who he is: a seasoned cellist compelled to decode the maestro’s legacy. His agency is decisive in choosing discord over melody to activate the code. Interiority comes through tactile perception and craft-specific noticing rather than labels, though contradictory impulses are subtle. The transformation at the end feels earned, if the personal cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to measure and release a buried truth—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (hovering at the periphery, choosing to smudge). Her interiority is embodied through altitude aftereffects and tactile engagement with the illustration; tears and physical gestures carry the cost. Thorne applies gentle pressure without stealing agency. The resolution skews slightly tidy, but it still reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alex’s skepticism versus compulsion to explore generates credible internal friction, and his tactile choices (examining then turning the valve) align with motive. The confession seed motivates the night journey and the later reinterpretation of his father. The final repricing—seeing the disappearance as escape—lands, though it edges on tidy and fast. Emotions are embodied (dust, beads, hiss) rather than labeled, strengthening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—“to witness change without judgment”—and his actions (unfolding/refolding the swan, leaving/returning) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; he rarely struggles or reveals contradictory impulses beyond a faint tug between lingering and returning. Embodied emotion leans abstract (“eyes like faded ink,” “gripped reality loosely”) over felt, situational stress. The endurance/ritual closure reads credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to rekindle wonder) and the cost-bearing vulnerability of revealing Lila’s curl are clear and consistent. “Cautious exuberance” versus not pushing Finn offers a credible internal tension, embodied in her adaptive music choices. Finn’s shift from guarded skepticism to tears happens quickly but is plausibly catalyzed by the eclipse and tactile link. Interiority leans summary at times, limiting depth of contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s motive—harvesting “wall-heard” stories—drives clear, consistent actions and culminates in a felt reorientation toward hope. Interiority is particular (the “bronze quiet,” tactile ash-sifting) but internal contradiction is minimal; he moves steadily from curiosity to confirmation. The trait “sensitively perceptive” does real work but leans label-first at times. The shift at the end reads earned, though the personal cost to Elias is subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—to transpose life into a new key—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (microdots in fortunes, midnight deliveries). Interiority is present but leans conceptual; we get little embodied conflict or risk during execution. The change at the end (relief from his fabricated past) lands but the cost is understated. Secondary figures function as pressures in absentia rather than on-page crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he aims to expose hidden assumptions—and his tactics track that goal. Interiority remains somewhat abstract, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Still, micro-choices (record, repeat, pause, restart) show agency calibrated to belief. The felt cost is modest (tendrils graze, strain), keeping the arc credible but not deeply transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (to “conduct” futures) intersects with the ache of being “chronologically homesick,” and fatigue pressures his choices. Interiority is particular (shell chambers mapped to memories) rather than generic. Contradictory pull—backward ache vs forward urge—is present but handled smoothly, with limited on‑page friction beyond stamina. The final renunciation of backward pull reads earned, though the cost registers chiefly as exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—“to conquer the labyrinth of self”—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (testing love, solitude, conquest, teaching) reveal layered contradiction. Emotional texture skews summary-heavy in the middle, but the final renunciation (becoming mortal) reads earned with felt cost. Embodiment appears in selective images (hovering, warmth of the tablet) yet sometimes defers to concept. Overall, strong motivation with credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive to break through numbness is clear and embodied (vibrations through stone, chest tightening). His micro‑choices (repurposing the broken needle, layering records, welcoming Mira) align with motive. Internal contradiction is mild—he’s largely steadfast rather than torn—so pressure on his blind spots is limited. Mira’s emotional thaw provides relational crucible but only for one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s meticulous integrity and measured curiosity are embodied in specific actions (calming the pigeon, refusing to rush the code, sending the tube back). The internal conflict—solitude/integrity versus alliance—operates simultaneously on the page. The final renunciation feels earned, though the emotional price is mostly implied rather than acutely felt. Distinct, non-generic interiority largely avoids stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crisp—he seeks to understand scent-triggered tears—and every micro‑choice (switching to UV, uncorking, re‑sealing) aligns with that drive under pressure. Interiority is embodied through scent and memory rather than labels, with a credible contradiction between caution and compulsion. One line edges toward telling—“He understood—the smells triggered tears because…”—but the insight is largely earned by on‑page experience. The final endurance/grief release reads as an earned stasis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—“to discover the texture of time”—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (tracing the rope, arranging souvenirs). Contradictory impulses are on the page: the temptation to invoke a being versus preserving his humanity. His ethically playful trait manifests in past limericks and the final third‑path refusal. The cost is felt in his renunciation of offered knowledge for continued, uncertain pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation—seeking beauty in the unfinished—drives all choices, culminating in the vow. Interiority is sensorial and particular (acoustic bias), but internal contradiction is minimal, so pressure feels gentle rather than contested. The ritual vow functions as an Earned Stasis, with a conceptual cost (renouncing completion). A touch more friction or doubt in the lead-up would deepen character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—fusing insight with empathy—and her methodical nature shows in micro‑choices (noting arc colors, cataloging anomalies). The “affectionate detachment” toward her past self offers a credible internal contradiction, but resistance is minimal and the process feels friction‑light. The transformation reads earned by history, yet the on‑page struggle is muted. The cost—relinquishing her former trade/home—is felt but not contested.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and character‑specific (ethics vs. curiosity vs. desire to honor “silent contributors”), and his micro‑choices (picking up the envelope, approaching Lira, promising support) align. The internal conflict is gentle rather than grinding, so the cost reads modest. Lira’s presence adds a relational crucible, though her arc is sketched rather than pressured. The final promise signals change, but it’s emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirah’s desire to “graft” into the community is clear and enacted through concrete choices (proposing the search, comforting others, teaching reed markers, dedicating the arbor). Interiority is largely rendered through lyrical image rather than contradictory impulses in scene, so the internal conflict feels gentle rather than pressurized. Her final integration reads earned but low‑cost. The character specificity (marsh‑reed craft, tactile gestures) is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—preserve the city by finding and freeing the echo-source—but internal contradiction is light and emotions skew summarized over embodied. The illustrator lens offers specificity (“her illustrations of aquatic beasts guiding her”) that informs a micro-choice. The final act (freeing the bird) reads as earned by prior belief and skill. However, we don’t feel a strong, on-page cost in her psyche at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation (to solve grief by “mathematics of emotion”) is precise and drives every choice, with tactile anchors (the glass eyes, the tracing). Interiority is specific and character‑particular; doubt and hope coexist credibly. The final stance (quiet hope without certainty) reads earned. Minor softness: struggle feels slightly too smooth, with little resistance beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to be visible only to those who need him—is clear, consistent, and culminates in an earned choice when he reveals himself. Interiority is particular and embodied through tactile detail (cool metal, oxide scent), with a plausible, steady temperament. The internal conflict is gentle rather than fraught; his shift feels inevitable rather than wrestled from competing impulses. Still, the final renunciation of invisibility (even if temporary) reads credible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity versus fear of bodily loss—are dramatized as she first fights the rooting vines, then chooses to surrender. Her motivation (to study plant behaviors) organically drives her mindset under pressure. The final renunciation of control is earned by prior scenes of meticulous control (soil pH, light). Felt cost is legible: she forfeits ordinary human stasis for a hybrid existence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s insomnia, trauma, and wry earnestness lead to concrete micro‑choices (venturing into the storm, following rain trails, relinquishing the brooch). The internal conflict—personal attachment versus the urge to connect—surfaces credibly at the exchange. Emotions are embodied through weather, mud, and artifacts, not labels. The renunciation (giving up the heirloom) reads as a meaningful, costed change.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s core motive—magnifying everyday magic—is clear and consistent, and her impulsive choice to take the pearl credibly catalyzes change. The internal turn from control (clairvoyance) to surrender (fluid possibilities) is present but could show more simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied beats like the pearl warming and her gasping help. Agency tilts passive at peak moments, with acceptance more assumed than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent, and her choices (picking up the valve, choosing staggered intervals) align with her archivist ethos. Interiority is textured through sensory focus rather than therapy-speak. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little resistance that forces a charged trade-off on the page. The visible cost of her stance is mostly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear (find the fortress and face his family’s disappearance) and actions align with it. Interiority has some specificity (mapping cracks, aligning with constellations), but emotional contradiction is modest and sometimes summarized. The confession is a credible micro‑cost, yet the final transformation (“bad habits shatter”) reads a touch tidy. Still, the hierarchy of values emerges through his choice to confess and board.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s sympathetic skepticism and courage-driven kindness are dramatized through concrete choices (returning to the tower to help even “a ghost”). Contradictory impulses act in scene—doubt vs. compassion—while embodied details (wind, stone, tile hum) keep emotion specific. The change—skepticism softened into wonder—feels earned by the ritual’s strain. Minor softness remains in the low-friction path to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s motive—escape from immortal boredom by finding the “after‑goodbye”—is clear and consistent, and her tactics (coaxing fields, aligning runes) align with it. Interiority is textured and embodied through sensory anchors (the storm’s vibration through her bones), though internal contradiction remains relatively simple (yearning for end vs. curse’s anchor). Micro‑choices under pressure register—she chooses subtlety over force. The cost lands via the fragment’s shattering, earning a modest but credible change in stance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—an honest child seeking a “mathematics of a fair trade”—and choices (testing the ink, deciding to breach) align under pressure. The internal contradiction (honesty vs. deceit) is dramatized rather than labeled, with the ink catalyzing a morally costly shift. Some thematic repetition slightly flattens the texture of interiority. The closing act—granting asylum despite “alerts”—reads as an earned stance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistently enacted through concrete tactics (charting the lamp, aligning spectra, custodian vs hoarder stance). Internal contradiction is light; he rarely wavers beyond a sharpened resolve at the end. The closing micro‑choice (to collect more despite the warning) reads, but the on‑page cost is mostly conceptual. Embodied emotion appears via ritualized action rather than conflicted feeling, limiting depth at the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent drive to reclaim erased identity through tactile memory “textures” gives the POV specificity. Interiority is sensorially rich and character‑particular, especially at the poison label reveal. However, micro-choices under pressure are limited to attention and collection; contradictory impulses surface only lightly. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but carries modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (debunking turned to decoding) and a credible contradiction (skeptic intrigued) give Elias texture. Micro-choices—the cello method, the decision to hum and retell—align with his traits. The cost is mostly conceptual (the compass fades), and struggle feels relatively smooth, muting deeper conflict. Still, interiority is particular and embodied by object handling.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lanara’s goal and dual allegiance are clear and consistent, and the stone chip/graffiti method reveals character through action. However, much of her struggle is summarized rather than dramatized as micro-choices under pressure. The most vivid, particular interiority arrives around the mural unveiling and talisman use, but earlier beats lean tell-y. The final stance feels earned, though the felt cost to her personally is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystal clear and sustained—she endures the night to photograph the final grain—and actions align (ascend, rig timed messages, wait, shoot). Interiority is specific (melancholy over fading hush), though internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers beyond fatigue. The chemical pep‑talks provide small micro‑choices that reveal value hierarchy. The final endurance lands as earned stasis with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is crystal clear and coherently embodied in tactile, auditory choices; his occupational competence feels lived-in. However, he encounters little genuine resistance—no mistake, doubt spike, or trade-off that forces him to adapt—so internal contradiction reads muted. The relationship with Mira functions but applies soft pressure rather than a crucible. The closing gratitude moment lands emotionally yet at minimal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive to locate the rivers’ beginnings is particular and felt, with dry wit masking real anxiety. Micro-choices—trusting the falcon’s coordinates, divining through condensation, rehearsing the phrasebook, then stepping onto the ice—align with his motives. The internal contradiction (subtle confidence vs. worry) is present on the page without being overexplained. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, but the commitment reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    Thorne’s motive and tactic are clear and consistent, and his endurance reads as a credible, earned stance. However, interiority is sparse and largely archetypal; we get little contradictory impulse or embodied emotional texture under pressure. The micro-choices (ritual, cadence, teaching by modeling) track, but conflict inside him is minimal. His departure suggests cost (solitude), but it lands more as function than character wound.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s want (to harness the ephemeral) is clear and credibly opposed by the survival urge as oxygen dwindles. Interiority is specific enough—breath control, trembling, the impossible scent—though it leans lyric over idiosyncratic texture. The decisive micro-choices (uncorking, slowing, unsnarling) align with her motive and reveal a hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction at peak beats keeps it just shy of piercingly character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—redeem a lineage of lies by forging a truthful narrative—and actions align (entering, seeking the chapel, confessing). Interiority carries specificity (“chasing hush” as a value), though contradictory impulses are minimal; he rarely wavers. The urgency “before they find the bodies” adds pressure but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off. The earned change is credible, if a touch tidy emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive (reviving the orchard and answering the karmic debt) is clear and sustained, with embodied costs (fatigue, yearning) that complicate his drive. His micro-choices—heeding her guidance, channeling the bead—track with his contradictions. The ghost bride has distinctive presence and pressure in brief dialogue. Some emotional shorthand repeats (“mournful elation,” “lovingly venomous”), flattening nuance at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to transform ruin into reverence—is clear and consistently embodied in tactile choices (sewing bridges, gardens, altar). Interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; we don’t feel a simultaneous tug of fear or doubt against her “haunting optimism.” The sleepwalking conceit limits on‑page deliberation, softening micro‑choices under pressure. Still, reactions to the plate and the crossings reveal character-specific drive without safety hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and temperament are clear, and her micro‑choices (pausing to touch ribs, deciding to wander and then rebuild the sundial) align with motive. The internal contradiction (cautious yet warmly curious) is present but lightly tested. Emotional embodiment via sensory detail is strong, though the restoration at the end lands a bit tidy. The cost of belief’s return is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—“to discover meaning in the margins”—is clear and embodied through her decoding and naming. Micro-choices (lingering despite time pressure, pocketing chalk to continue the cycle) reveal values. Internal contradiction is mild; the piece lacks a charged opposing impulse beyond gentle clock pressure. Still, her actions align coherently with her vocation and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive—to glean adjacent narratives to foil a looming coup—is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her competence is compelling, but internal contradiction and felt cost are light; she rarely wavers or pays a visible price for probing dangerous knowledge. The “foolishness” disguise hints at duality, yet the scene doesn’t force a hard trade‑off. Still, micro‑choices (lighting the needle, pushing deeper) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—reclaiming the breath before the shattering word—is clear and specific, and her contradictory impulses (cryptic facade vs. longing to confess) surface under pressure. Embodied emotion lands (blood drawn, tears, tactile tracing on glass) rather than diagnostic shorthand. The resolution edges tidy—“a promise to speak truths henceforth”—with limited on‑page cost beyond the confrontation itself. Still, the internal arc feels earned by concrete actions tied to her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s pacifist translator identity and quiet drive are embodied through specific micro-choices (approaching in his dialect, asking to read the cast, offering the coral). Her “shrewdly innocent” posture functions on the page, softening Amir’s defenses without erasing her acuity. Internal contradiction—numbed physical scar vs. live emotional wound—animates the scene credibly. The closing act of giving away the coral registers as a small but felt cost that earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s desire to reclaim lost joy is clear and drives specific actions (prying the fragment, activating the network, painting with light). Interiority is textured (“pensive mirth”) and embodied through tactile engagement with the environment. However, pressure is gentle and struggle minimal; contradictory impulses surface more as mood than as on‑page dilemma. The final fulfillment feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core drive—trading certainty for curiosity—is clear and consistent, and her “methodically playful” trait informs her tactics. The doubt beat (“was this real, or another layer?”) gives a flicker of inner friction but doesn’t bite hard. Emotional cost is mostly conceptual (“predictable strokes” vs. wonder) rather than embodied in a pressured choice. Still, actions align with motive and the final stance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular—Elias protects his “spark of defiance”—and his micro‑choices (leading the planting, seizing and shaking the gourd) align. The roguish charm and “candidly cryptic” idiom are consistent. However, interior contradiction is thin; he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses under pressure, which flattens complexity at the peak. The final endurance reads earned but at low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elowen’s motive—transmuting pain into beauty to end a centuries-long longing—is vivid and consistent, and his choice to begin the lullabies provides concrete agency. The “shyly unstoppable” trait maps to behavior (persistent singing over eras), but contradictory impulses are lightly rendered; we rarely see doubt or a competing desire on the page. Interiority remains largely lyric rather than pressured moment-to-moment. The final shift (insomnia easing) feels earned by prior persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s drive—to preserve the sound of forgotten names—governs every choice and aligns cleanly with her careful, ritual competence. Interiority is specific (the “foxglove regret”) and embodied in her handling of the cracked tube. The internal conflict is quieter than ideal—she endures more than she wrestles—but the final renunciation (accepting temporariness; returning to rounds) has credible cost. Micro‑choices are present and character‑particular, if not deeply contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s goal (restore trust before Thorne leaves) is clear and rooted in a believable blend of trepidation and thrill that fits “carefully reckless.” Her micro-choices—selecting specific tongues, crafting promises, and summoning Thorne—align with motive. Internal contradiction is present but mild; the resolution lands without much struggle. The relationship pivot reads earned, though the cost is mostly anticipatory (they still part) rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, specific motivation (bridge sacred and extractive aims) and embodied emotion (“dappled resolve,” hands trembling). Micro‑choices—investigate adhesive, decode, integrate chain—track with his competence. However, internal contradiction is modest and pressure light; doubt doesn’t force a costly trade. The resolution reads emotionally sincere but largely untested by opposing forces on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s fear/longing conflict is specific and embodied (dust‑mapping, aviary routine, meteorite as talisman). His final choice—to send a “message not of reinvention, but of raw truth”—feels earned by prior practice. Costs are legible in the risk of renewed betrayal and the waiting beat. Slight reliance on summarized time softens moment‑to‑moment micro‑choices.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias seeks to understand sacred thresholds—and his actions (wood‑grain analysis, cross‑referencing the logbook) align. However, internal conflict is muted and the epiphany lands a bit tidily, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The felt cost of reframing his loss as “essential” is present but soft. Strong interiority with specific methods keeps the character from reading generic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s longing for belonging motivates coherent choices (salvaging, venturing, ritual), and her isolation vs. yearning is credibly felt. However, contradictory impulses do not surface under pressure in the moment-to-moment beats; she meets little resistance. The final renunciation—being “forever attuned”—reads as acceptance of a new self, though the cost (foreclosing nomadism) is implied more than dramatized. Still, reactions to the feather and guardians reveal character with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific, and the “cheerful gloom” contradiction gives her interiority texture. Micro‑choices (turning to the seeds, testing hypotheses with the crater glass) align with her role. However, pressure on her psyche remains gentle; no moment forces a costly trade‑off beyond a tempered acceptance. The arc lands as credible endurance rather than a hard renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive and consistent traits (“analytical,” “lightly attentive”) drive Elias’s choices, and his orchestration reads credible and embodied. However, interior contradiction is thin—he rarely strains or pays a personal price beyond anonymity—so the arc feels steady rather than pressured. Mira’s brief interior line creates a faint POV blur without deepening Elias’s internal stakes. The closing satisfaction lands but lacks a felt cost that would sharpen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—inscribing a cosmic verse to transcend enforced forgetting—is clear and embodied in the thorn, blood, and moonstone dust. Panic-then-acceptance gives a credible micro-struggle under pressure. Interior stakes are specific to her craft (tide dancing in a landlocked exile). The only limit is that contradiction remains relatively simple, not deeply double-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—Elias seeks to “illuminate the value in the mundane” before the bay changes—and his ritual choice aligns with that aim. Interiority is embodied through tactile details (chill air, stone in palm) and a professional lens. However, internal contradiction is mild; pressure never draws out a true clash of impulses beyond quiet resistance vs acceptance. The final stance is earned but low‑cost, leaning more contemplative than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eli’s motives and history are specific and embodied (the porcelain box, guiding Mia), and his vulnerability at the cliffside moment reads as a credible cost. Internal contradiction is present but mild—he’s “granite wrapped in moss,” yet he encounters little resistance once he decides to open the box. Mia functions as foil more than pressure; her thinness limits relational crucible. The final sharing choice is earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific (to engineer “equations for hope”), and her competence reads consistently through tool use and patterned tactics. However, there’s little visible internal tension or contradictory impulse under pressure; her “lucidly watchful” stance avoids real degradation or doubt. Micro-choices exist (shell spiral, kelp radial, driftwood cluster), but they’re low-risk and near-surefooted. The ending offers endurance/affirmation rather than a change with cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive—lightening an inherited burden by decoding “what walls dream”—is specific and coherently pursued through tactile choices (listening, squeezing through ivy, handling diaries). Interiority is focused and character‑particular, though the internal contradiction (duty vs. fear or doubt) stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in a live impasse. The emotional turn at the fireplace reads earned through accumulated observation. The vow at the end lands, but the cost is largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular: he must “persuade mirrors” before returning a borrowed heartbeat. Interiority is embodied through the ritual—pigments with twilight dew, coded lullabies—rather than abstract labels. Internal conflict exists but is subdued; the cost-awareness (“soon, he would return it”) shades action without producing sharp contradictory impulses. Micro‑choices (site selection, song modulation, channeling the heartbeat) align with motive and accrue toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—redemption by binding ideals to action—is clear and consistently drives her choices. The internal conflict (guilt vs. resolve) is present but largely summarized rather than dramatized under immediate pressure. Embodied emotion lands in the siphoned vitality and dimmed eyes, but earlier beats lean on declarative framing. The “operatively gentle” trait informs her method credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑specific contradiction—amoral image‑launderer driven by a buried tenderness—animates motive and action. Interiority is embodied through tactile choices (tracing fissures, whispering to the egg) rather than labels. His final renunciation (ruining profits by opening the valve and cracking the egg) is earned and costly. A touch of summarized backstory compresses struggle but doesn’t undercut the on‑page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to defy conformity is clear and consistent, embodied in the delicate, risk‑laden ritual. Interiority is present through fear vs yearning (“alarming serenity,” watchful eyes) though contradiction could be sharpened. Micro‑choices—thread by thread, not shattering the crystal—reveal values in action. The cost is mostly implied (court’s wrath), not borne on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority with credible contradiction: a polished manipulator seeking ethical repair. Embodied action with the story stick and the prototypes grounds the psyche. The renunciation of deceptive commissions in favor of risky bar puppetry reads earned by the argument’s residue. Occasional label‑like thematic phrasing slightly flattens the emotional grain.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—to honor overlooked histories through ephemeral monuments—is clear and enacted via concrete micro-choices (gathering, knotting, humming, releasing). The internal tension between orchestrating tribute and witnessing emerges at the butterfly’s interruption, producing an earned renunciation. Embodied cues (warm cheeks, deliberate hands) anchor the lyric register. Depth is strong for this length; the character remains particular rather than archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is vivid and coherent—preserve the sound of names—rooted in her craft and the recent self-forgiveness. Interiority is embodied through tactile work with rope and card, not just labels. Limited contradiction on the page (the guilt has already transformed), which slightly flattens live internal conflict. Micro-choices (how to rebraid, when to tug) align with “technically gentle” and reveal values.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (forcing the door, choosing to sleep to interpret) align with it under pressure from the storm. Interiority is textured and embodied, though internal contradiction is mild (resolve largely outweighs doubt). The epiphany is earned via the dream method established on the page. Cost is present but light (physical risk and years of questing rather than a sharp on‑page sacrifice).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias seeks a covenant to bridge science and the unknown—and his frugality colors concrete choices. The internal contradiction (empiricist using enchantment) is present but under‑pressured on the page. Interiority is serviceable yet rarely conflicted moment‑to‑moment; he meets little resistance. The ending earns an endurance-style commitment with implied cost, though the sacrifice isn’t sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifist” motivation is clear and consistently enacted through nonviolent strategy, and Thorne’s embodied resentment (rigid stance, convulsion) reads credibly. Their dynamic is simple but effective within the scene’s limits. The change in Thorne is earned by on‑page beats, though it resolves neatly with limited visible cost. Interiority leans abstract at times, skimming deeper contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and specific (recovering the runaway dream to touch his late wife’s memory), and his “firmly grounded” craft meets a metaphysical longing in a credible way. Interiority is embodied through breath and tactile making, not labels. However, the scene offers little friction or contradictory impulse at the peak; he meets no real setback before success. The resolution feels earned but low-cost, with limited struggle to complicate his values hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (to pass on impermanence to Lila) is clear and embodied by concrete micro‑choices under pressure (twining himself secure, tossing apples, mending a vine). His feisty defiance collides credibly with grief, producing a lived contradiction rather than a tidy lesson. The shift from grief‑stalled to reframed vows feels earned through the on‑page catalysts (poem, shard, ribbon). Interiority leans lyrical over granular bodily sensation, but it stays character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive for forbidden knowledge is clear and active, with embodied beats like pressing the cameo to the mirror and continuing despite the crack as warning. His contradictory impulses (awe vs dread) coexist rather than alternate, and the final stance—curate the nonlinear threads—feels earned. Some interiority leans conceptual over sensory, trimming a hint of visceral specificity at peak moments. Still, the micro-choices track cleanly to motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s careful resourcefulness motivates the renegotiation tactic and the diary‑based problem‑solving, while Thorne’s desperation drives urgency. Interiority remains mostly conceptual (the “unheard symphony”) rather than embodied conflict, so contradictory impulses are muted. Relationship pressure exists but is underexplored beyond functional collaboration. The final endurance—accepting a constrained vow—registers as a soft cost but reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to reclaim/recapture her twin through storytelling is clear and consistent, and her “trapped freedom” tension gives her interiority texture. The emerald swatch card catalyzes micro‑choices (where she sits, what she says, how she recalls). Some emotions are asserted rather than embodied, and the twin’s voice integration skews told over dramatized. The final step off the ship reads earned but the felt cost is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent (“translate confusion into clarity”), and her actions align with it throughout. However, interior conflict is minimal; she encounters overwhelm but not a true value clash or flawed impulse. Competence dominates with little felt cost or compromise. The final choice feels earned but easy, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—hammered repose over fragile silence—is clear and drives her choices. Interiority is present but largely articulated through lyrical description rather than conflicting impulses under pressure. She reads highly competent, with little on‑page flaw or hesitation to complicate the ritual. The cost is mostly endurance, not a trade that forecloses a future option.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained—rekindle the beacon to prove pattern over chaos—and her actions align with it at each beat. Interiority is specific enough (visions, bodily cost with “hands bleeding”) but lacks layered contradiction; she rarely wavers or misreads under stress. The final certainty lands, but the emotional price is modest, keeping the change credible yet not profound. Strong, coherent, a touch too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and constant—she must salvage a collective identity before the echoes vanish—and her tactics align with that drive. The interiority is textured but largely one‑directional; contradictory impulses are faint (urgency vs. reverence) rather than dramatized under pressure. Micro‑choices (which shadow to measure, what conjecture to adopt, when to ink) show craft competence but little visible cost beyond ache. The culminating self‑redefinition reads earned, though the on‑page price remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and specific—defying a felt “gravity of hopelessness”—and actions (lighting and spinning the rag) align under pressure. Interiority is embodied via chants, sensory focus, and the tactile ritual with the rag. Contradictory impulses (weariness vs. playful risk) coexist credibly. A believable reorientation occurs with modest but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s quietly driven motive and tactic (observe, then act obliquely) are coherent and embodied; Elara’s nerves are shown in tactile ways. The handoff of the cicada is a credible, modest turn consistent with his temperament. Internal contradiction is light—Kael rarely wavers or risks exposure—so the cost feels mostly implied rather than dramatized. Relationship pressure is present but kept gentle, limiting how far characterization can deepen under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s want (to collect silences to ease claustrophobia) is specific and consistently drives choices under pressure. The internal contradiction—fear of confinement vs. pursuit of isolation-bred hush—plays on the page during the inversion window and the cupping/warding tactics. Interiority is mostly embodied via sensory images rather than labels. The father is off‑stage and functions as pressure-background rather than a crucible, slightly limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to teach silence as balm—drives concrete tactics (altered pole rhythm, pauses, revealing his loss). Mira’s arc from harried chatter to attuned quiet is legible and earned through interaction with the vial and space. Interiority is present but not deeply contradictory; her shift feels slightly smooth, with limited frictive back‑and‑forth. Still, their relationship functions as crucible with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is strong and consistent, but internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely hesitates or pays a personal price beyond urgency. The “wisely adventurous” blend is shown in methodical peeling paired with bold infiltration, yet the path is smooth. Embodied emotion appears (“heart ached,” “heart pounding”) but remains generalized rather than character‑particular under stress. The final choice feels earned but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—compassionate severance to help the suffocating breathe—is clear and enacted under pressure, with micro-choices (summoning, linking, releasing) revealing her values. Interiority is steady and particular, though largely composed, with limited contradictory impulses on the page. The relationship with Lorin functions as a crucible with a felt cost (renewed solitude, sealed threshold). A touch more fray or destabilization under stress would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting past pressure into diamonds—is clear and consistent, and her “virtuously mischievous” streak informs small choices (spore-sharing, playful lever-rigging). Interiority is present but light; she rarely wrestles with contradictory impulses beyond a brief heartbeat before agreeing. The choice to dive feels earned but almost too smooth, with minimal on-page hesitation or cost. Still, actions align with motive and reveal character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, compelling motivation and a steady interior lens; Elias’s choice to return and engage the mechanism tracks with his goal. However, internal contradiction is light—he rarely wavers or pays through visible struggle, making the change feel more confirmation than crucible. Embodied emotion lands via tactile choices (turning the crank, pocketing it) but leans on reiterated abstractions. The renunciation at the end reads earned but largely conceptual in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and coherent—his quiet drive to “capture the shape of possibility”—and actions align (studying the program, performing the ritual, unsnapping the gauntlet). The internal tension between withdrawal and binding allegiance is present but under-tested; success comes with little friction. Embodied emotion works, though “shivering bliss” recurs enough to feel formulaic. The final renunciation (the gauntlet) reads as a believable cost scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—mending herself by uncovering “small kindnesses”—is clear and consistent, and her archivist lens gives her interiority specificity. The dust‑reading and choice to digitize show micro‑choices aligned with her values. However, internal contradiction under pressure is mild; the decision entails limited visible cost. A touch of told sentiment (“broken heart stir with possibility”) softens the edge of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear and drive action, but interior contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or wavers under pressure. Embodied emotion appears (rain‑slick streets, heart pounding) but much feeling is declared in thematic language (“tyranny of indifference”). Micro‑choices (memorizing puddle‑constellations, improvising with reflections) reveal priorities. Cost registers via captured comrades and risk of capture, though the emotional price remains somewhat summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation and a handful of concrete micro‑choices (choosing the atrium’s center; phrased pauses; the whispered “enough”) reveal character under pressure. Embodied feeling comes via sensory anchors (dew, breath, light) and the ache of remembered nights. Internal contradiction is mild—lonely nostalgia versus duty—so the struggle reads steady rather than riven. The cost lands as weariness and self‑sacrifice, felt but not scarring.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions (building monuments, using the moonstone speck) align with that aim. However, interior contradiction and felt cost are minimal—she encounters no meaningful doubt or friction. Embodied emotion is present (“mossy delight”) but skews one-note. The arrival of the Leaf Whisperer confirms her worldview rather than testing or complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradiction—precision addict learning to improvise—drives concrete choices (following the ticks, tying the compass to a pendulum, reading leaves). Embodied fear at the ledge provides felt pressure. However, declarations like “His motivation stirred: to befriend uncertainty” flatten nuance and telegraph the arc. The final shift feels earned but a touch over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation (redemption/understanding the weight of names) and a coherent inner weather of regret. Interiority is concrete in objects and procedures, but contradictory impulses rarely act simultaneously on the page. The ritual proceeds with minimal visible struggle, softening pressure on his choices. The final acceptance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her “modestly fearless” stance is dramatized through invitation over coercion. Interiority is present but not deeply contradictory; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond steadiness. Thorne’s guilt is specific (the abandoned companion) and embodied by the tooth, but his resistance is brief. The change at the end feels earned yet emotionally low-friction for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her proprioceptive enhancement grounds her interiority in embodied specifics. The contradiction—seeking a “mathematics of mercy” for a tormentor while reliving her own complicity—adds credible tension. The final shift feels earned by the trauma waves and the guilt of naming a comrade. A slight neatness in the concluding certainty softens the messy human ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is concrete and sustained—honoring overlooked histories drives every move. Interiority is present but tends toward summary over embodied contradiction; we get little friction between competing impulses. Her choices align with goals (seeking the painter, using the lens), but visible cost is soft. The “reckoning” remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized through a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, character-rooted motivation (his obsession with ceilings and childhood loss) drives each move, and his competence feels grounded in the occupation. Interiority is present through embodied perception (lights, dust, “weightless burden”) but contradictory impulses are thin—he rarely hesitates or pays an evident price. The lone line of dialogue functions, but relationship pressure is absent. The ending change reads earned but emotionally low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motive (compress eternity to reclaim a beloved’s echo) drives concrete choices. Interiority is vivid and embodied through craft details (frost-reading, inking, the press) rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulse emerges late—his yearning versus the risk to the library—so the inner conflict doesn’t fully complicate earlier beats. Still, the final acceptance of an imperfectly altered system reads earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to reclaim a suppressed history and redeem his failed revolution—drives clear micro‑choices (builds a sanctuary, deciphers the shard, reframes the narrative). Interiority is specific enough to feel character‑particular (poetic lens, “burnished sorrow”), though contradictory impulses under pressure are light. The renunciation of mere poetry‑as‑solace for evidence‑backed elegy reads as earned. Emotional embodiment is present but skews declarative in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive is clear and constant, and his micro-choices (truth‑checking via ferns, recommitting under doubt) track his temperament. The mentor’s betrayal supplies a credible internal counterforce, though conflict resolves without lasting personal cost. Interiority is specific to a tinkerer’s lexicon and embodied through tools and sound. The piece leans allegorical, keeping complexity modest but coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular (pursuing the place “where explanations fail”), and her occupational lens (petrichor collector) informs choices and perceptions. However, internal contradiction and cost are light; she moves from attic to lagoon with minimal friction or doubt. The “hinged awakenings” show progression but little simultaneous conflict of impulses. The closing repricing of her eccentricity reads earned but emotionally low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motive—translating historical complexity into simple forms—aligns cleanly with her choices once the slide appears, and her occupational specificity reads credible. However, internal contradiction is light: inspiration quickly resolves into confident making, with little on‑page doubt, risk, or competing impulse. Embodied emotion (storm vibrations through bone; heartbeat syncing with the gale) lands, but the lack of a fraught trade‑off keeps the arc modest. The final commitment promises future work rather than foreclosing a costly path now.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and the ancestry thread grounds why this matters to her. However, interior conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in present action; we don’t see contradictory impulses tested in a live beat. The final choice—accepting the message and reorienting her art—feels earned but relatively low-cost. Embodied emotion appears (tears, ritual dawn work) but often yields to lyrical telling.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, compelling motivation and embodied stress (“vines around his soul,” blistering sand) anchor Elias’s choices, culminating in the costly offer “FORGIVE TO FREE.” Internal contradiction (duty vs. the psychic toll/absolution bargain) is present but not deeply layered. The archivist’s competence and ingenuity feel character‑specific in the debris‑code tactic. A richer sense of his fear or doubt in the moment of offering forgiveness would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s resolve and renunciation are clear, with a brief, credible temptation by the bottle. Interiority favors summary over scene, limiting contradictory impulses beyond that single pull. The endurance choice (rejecting false comfort, committing to labor) lands and feels earned. Greater on‑page struggle or a costlier micro‑loss would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motive—to archive emotional patterns before they vanish—is clear and consistently drives his micro‑choices (chanting, pressing the wax to his forehead). His interiority is embodied and specific (museum memory, musty scent, trembling fingers) with a credible contradiction between duty and fear of obsolescence. The realization that his archive seeded prophecy reconfigures him without a tidy fix, landing as earned purpose rather than epiphany-lite. Minimal external opposition keeps the pressure mostly internal but still effective.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive—“to discover the texture of borrowed time” and reopen the inheritance—is clear and drives concrete choices (placing the cap, invoking order, stepping into the vortex). Interiority is vivid and character‑specific, with embodied cues (“calloused,” “cold biting,” trembling). However, her competency smooths the path; little friction or flaw complicates the peak decision, softening cost. The emotional contradiction (“furiously tranquil”) surfaces but isn’t tested against a hard counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he privileges listening over alarm—and the hesitation at the bell rope shows live, contradictory impulses. The “credibly curious” trait drives the key tactic shift to microclimate tracking. Embodied moments (coarse rope, wind mist, chill hands) ground his interiority. The final renunciation reads earned, though the emotional cost is mostly anticipatory risk rather than a paid consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and interior conflict (hiding vs. a path to inner power) are clear, with concrete micro-choices (fitting the glass, tracing the path, pausing before cleaning) that reveal character. Embodied beats—warmth of the glass, tears, tactile tracing—ground the lyricism. The final recommitment (“guardian of vulnerabilities”) feels earned if modest in cost. Occasional abstract phrasing (“find strength in vulnerability”) flattens specificity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent—preserve the unspoken—and his choices (to unearth, to gaze rather than pry, to enshrine) align with his tranquil perceptiveness. The emotional cost is mostly internal and quiet, but present in his refusal to open the box and his acceptance of guardianship. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized, limiting intensity. The Mira ghost beat reveals character through restraint rather than confession.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—grasping the “texture of time”—is vivid and consistent, expressed through tactile beats (hourglass tattoos, sifting relics). Agency is present in her sequence of choices (climb, sift, decode, arrange, speak). Internal contradiction is mild; urgency versus curiosity never truly clashes, so stakes feel more devotional than pressured. The final “extension” of borrowed time lands, but the cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in Elias’s established ethos of finding beauty in incompletion, and his choices (approach, recitation, re‑feathering) align with it. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, though internal contradiction is minimal, with little friction or doubt under pressure. The cost is soft (time, vulnerability, acceptance of partial healing) rather than a sharp trade‑off. Still, actions reveal values credibly at the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive is precise and sustained: to build a bridge of respect before death. His serenity under pressure reads particular, though internal contradiction is minimal, limiting tension. Embodied cost appears (fatigue, time) but is mostly observed rather than forcing a hard trade‑off. The closing peace feels earned, if somewhat pre‑told by his steadiness.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—resisting alien assimilation to study “the chemistry of homecoming”—is clear and propulsive, and her choices (designing the pilgrimage, following the footprints, accepting the amber) align. Internal conflict is present but mostly summarized; we don’t feel a sharp on‑page cost when her skepticism softens. Secondary characters apply light pressure without deep relational stakes. The shift reads earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—he arrives to restore life and acts on that aim through concrete micro‑choices (listening, selecting sites, crushing pods). However, interior conflict is minimal; he meets little resistance, and we seldom glimpse contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion appears through ritualized action more than felt stress. The endurance/cost reads as the expenditure of finite pods and solitude, but it’s lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to close distance and find her brother—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (decoding the cylinder, deciding to leave). Her doubt at the end (“were these revelations enough?”) gives a flicker of internal conflict, though it’s not deeply dramatized. Tracker’s small but pointed interventions (nudging the crate, leading her out) reveal a quiet relationship dynamic under pressure. Emotional embodiment is present but leans more lyric than contradictory in-the-moment impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to transmute isolation into exploration—is clear and consistently enacted through sketching, alignment, and the decision to mine logs. Interiority is sensorially grounded (breath as “elongated threads,” the compass’s warmth). Internal contradiction (shunned yet “blessed”) is present but lightly dramatized rather than pressure‑tested. The final stance shift reads earned, though the on‑page cost remains conceptual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clean and embodied—he steals “to amend,” not to profit—and his “sacredly playful” code guides nonviolent choices like dancing through wards and swapping rather than breaking. Interiority is present but safe; we’re told his ethos often instead of feeling contradictory impulses under peak pressure. Competence slightly flattens struggle; fear and duty rarely collide on the page beyond “cautious abandon.” Still, micro‑choices around which piece to swap and bowing to the Archmage show character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alex’s goal and trait set (“benevolently ruthless”) drive on‑page action, and the pawnless chessboard reaction scene externalizes his values. The backstory of a crisis actor turned real survivor enriches motive without derailing the present. However, internal contradiction is articulated more than dramatized; we rarely see a live tug‑of‑war between mercy and will in the moment. Cost to him remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s need to avoid pain versus her drive to reclaim “the shape of home” gives credible internal contradiction, and her micro‑choices (lifting the stone, committing to the rite, breaking the orb) align with that motive. Interiority is particular—mercury‑glass, feather texture, “hidden thunder”—though some emotions are told rather than fully embodied. The renunciation of nightly substitutions reads earned with visible cost. A slightly glossier ease to the success of the rite modestly reduces struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and persistent—he seeks self-forgiveness—and his micro-choices (sitting before the tapestry, decoding, aligning the labyrinth) align with that drive. Interiority is tangible and character-specific (arrogance, misread traps), though the forgiveness arrives a touch smoothly. Contradictory impulses surface (self-blame vs. determination), but the struggle could bite harder. The final renunciation reads earned, with a felt emotional cost more reflective than scarring.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to earn forgiveness by refracting her guilt—drives consistent, on‑page choices (sitting at the spire, persisting through sessions). The defiant/mischievous tension is credible and active in the playful stanza that complicates blame. Cost is legible: her readiness requires surrendering innocence for wisdom. Interiors skew lyric but stay character‑particular rather than generic therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elowen’s doubt-to-action arc is clear and embodied—burning lungs, trembling hands, micro‑choices to press the charm into each pockmark. Motivation (“conjure meaning from oblivion”) aligns with his tactics and intensifies under pressure. A few lines state the inner thesis too directly (“repair not just the statue, but…the fabric of his own existence”), slightly blunting complexity. Still, the final stance feels earned by on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (honoring a hidden promise to confront his past) is clear and consistently drives action, and embodied beats (tracing his aging face; tears in the grotto) ground emotion. The contradiction—clinging to nostalgia versus releasing it—registers, though the epiphany lands a touch tidily. His “intimately aloof” trait appears more as label than a live constraint on choices. The final shift to painting the present feels earned but relatively smooth compared to the intensity promised.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motive is clear and consistent—prove whispers trump shouts and reach Mira—and his ritual choice aligns with it. Interiority is textured (the cork’s warmth, the moonless garden) but leans abstract in peak beats (“screaming tenderness”) rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. He faces little internal resistance once the dawn arrives, so the final embrace lacks a felt trade‑off beyond softened grief. The relationship beat at the end is moving but arrives pre‑earned rather than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—mapping grief through making—filtered through tactile, character‑particular details (bone/brass fingers, stitched body). Interiority carries embodied ache without therapy‑speak, though contradictory impulses rarely press simultaneously; the navigator mostly moves with serene competence. Micro‑choices (which relic, which numbers to dial, when to proceed under a crescent vs. wait) align with motive. The ending’s endurance costs are felt but not sharply foreclosing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal (to shield her psyche) is clear and rooted in the involuntary-truth flaw and rational forager mindset; the choice to commit to a discredited ritual under storm pressure reads motivated. The internal tension—reason vs. arcane remedy—is present but under-exploited in-scene (she rarely wavers). Embodied beats (boots in moss, wind tearing her cloak, anointing the eye) reveal her under pressure. The ending’s acceptance of “honest occlusion” signals an earned stance shift, though the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s eccentricity and solitude are vivid, and his motive—to decode the stranger’s gesture—flows cleanly from character. The acceptance of “borrowed memories” and the vow to pursue the gaps read as credible, if a touch untested by counter‑impulse. Internal contradiction (comfort in isolation vs. duty as witness) is present but not pressed hard; he rarely falters before committing. Embodied reactions (lantern as metronome, mist as touch) reveal him under pressure without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clean and character‑specific: a widower bound by Clara’s promise and his map‑dealer temperament. The “empirically intuitive” trait is dramatized in choices (map alignment, chip assessment, ant‑tracking), not just labeled. Internal conflict (evidence vs. hunch; clinging vs. release) is present but could cut deeper at the vision beat, which resolves swiftly. Felt cost of letting go is there but slightly cushioned by the benevolent vision.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive (disenchantment + truth‑seeking) is clear and her micro‑choices (leaving after the warning, saving Lir, initiating the ritual, dipping fingers despite temptation) align with it. The brief hesitation at the pool shows a live internal conflict, though interiority skews descriptive over character‑particular psychology. Lir provides light relational pressure and a counterpoint (“It’s a trap”), but doesn’t meaningfully alter Elara’s course. The closing resolve reads earned, with only a modest felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve and revalue the moment and risk the friendship—reads clear and character‑specific, and her choices drive each turn. Interiority is vivid if somewhat idealized; contradictory impulses (fear of loss vs. desire to ignite) are present but lightly tested. The sacrifice of the nautilus and the decision to “return differently” credibly earn the final stance. Slight overcontrol and near‑instant resolve reduce felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, credible motive (to tame chaos into narrative) drives concrete choices (inducing lucidity, leaping, touching the grave, writing). Embodied details (birch bark texture, cold air, pine scent) ground emotion. Internal contradiction—envy of past selves versus the chronicler’s discipline—operates in-scene and resolves credibly. Minor deduction for label-y abstractions (“feral nostalgia,” “jaded wonder”) doing some emotional lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation—transmuting the loss of smell into a search for “ordinary miracles”—is clear and enacted through her precise, tactile work and the choice to disclose vulnerability. The dynamic with Mira is gently pressurized and reveals character via subtext (pregnancy, grief) rather than exposition. Internal contradiction is present but mild; Elara is steady more than torn, so the emotional hinge relies on openness rather than a hard trade‑off. The change lands as credible endurance with connection rather than a drastic pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting trauma into narrative runes—drives every choice, culminating in selecting superstition over force when crystals lock her. Contradictory impulses (anxiety-induced crystallization vs. disciplined ritual focus) are embodied and active in scene. The micro-choices with the quill and mantra reveal character-specific hierarchy of values. The cost is felt as she risks pain to avoid shattering skin and reenters a charged ceremony changed.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive (an overdue apology) is clear and pressurized by guilt and time, and her choices (score selection, uncorking the bottle, the apology itself) align with that drive. Interiority is specific to her odd vocation and metaphor-habits without drifting into therapy-speak. The sister’s brief presence carries real reproach, sharpening Elara’s flaw. The final renunciation—accepting partial forgiveness—lands with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority stays archetypal and abstract, with limited contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The Witness “journeys inward” yet experiences little friction beyond recollection; doubt is gestured at then immediately resolved by the dictionary. Choices align with motive, but the path reads smooth and inevitable. The final renunciation/endurance component is minimal, making the change feel largely conceptual rather than personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive is clear and enacted: he uses the key, reverses the flow, and adopts the counting method to reach an insight. Interiority is specific (squinting at inverted bubbles; feeling cold) and filtered through his vocation. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the epiphany comes with little visible cost beyond solitude and chill. The change feels credible but safe in emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (protect the farm, decipher “the physics of letting go”) is clear and enacted through concrete choices: scanning, mapping, directing, and proposing the recalibration. Interiority is specific to her spatial gift and grief, and her change—naming Kai and revising the barrier philosophy—feels earned. The relationship shifts from adjacency to alliance credibly under pressure. Some thematic self‑explanation (“I’ve noticed you too”; explicit talk of entropy) trims a touch of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradiction—calculating professor vs. gambler’s daughter—drives credible choices (following graffiti, lighting the lantern) with embodied cues (“heart pounding,” petrichor). Her vow reads earned by the on‑page quest rather than a summary epiphany. The cost is implied (risking her safe pedagogy), though it isn’t deeply dramatized. Slight repetition of her “theoretically rebellious” label softens sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—curating “endings that begin”—is clear and drives his tactics, and his micro‑choices (rerouting, timing the cut, initiating loops) align. The inward turn when the musician pierces the veil reveals a credible contradiction between principled estrangement and personal isolation. However, much of his interiority arrives as summary rather than embodied reaction, softening the felt cost. The closing resolve toward “perhaps above ground” lands but could carry sharper, on‑page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (“preserve the weight of small moments”) drives every micro‑choice and aligns with the archivist’s walnut‑ink craft. The embodied ritual (diluting ink, steeping the photo) reveals him under pressure with tactile specificity. Internal contradiction is present but mild—purpose vs. grief, solace vs. duty—so the arc lacks a sharper rupture. The final acceptance of “euphoric haunting” reads as earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation (a cure for loneliness) is specific and consistent, and his choice to expose himself—offering the moon rock and demanding reciprocal stories—reveals credible inner contradiction between elusiveness and desire to connect. Embodied details (forced puns, slipping away before gratitude) make him particular. Secondary characters are lightly sketched but serve immediate pressure through reciprocity. The visible cost is mild but present: he trades safety for vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motivation (seeking solace after Liran’s death) drives embodied choices (dowsing, following note‑vibrations). Interiority is textured through touch‑language and grief images, though contradiction and error are minimal—he rarely falters or self‑sabotages. The acceptance at the end feels earned but a touch tidy, with little visible cost beyond the journey’s strain. Still, the sensory‑bound mindset and micro‑choices (ring, bark, earth) reveal character credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—atoning by “threshing meaning”—is clear and the doubt/resolve tension reads in her “confidently uncertain” handling of the controls and pen. Micro‑choices (tuning receivers, confessing in the broadcast, deciding to write revisions) reveal her values. However, the path to resolution feels low‑friction, with little on‑page cost or contradictory impulse at the peak. The finale’s serenity slightly tidies away ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (clinging to quiet vs. longing to compose) is clear and embodied in small, pressured micro‑choices with the empty camera and hesitant signing. The relationship with Thorne functions as a crucible that coaxes action without coercion. The final shift—accepting disruption and translating mapped silence into melody—feels earned with a legible cost (relinquishing protective obscurity). A few lines verge on thematic declaration, but the interiority mostly stays concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—honoring Mira’s promise reframes his arsonist guilt into a preservational drive. Interiority is particular (tracing chisel scars; tears as “volcanic tenderness”), and micro‑choices (inferring the alcove, decoding the cuts, deciding to recreate the tapestry) reveal character under pressure. The internal contradiction—destroyer vs guardian—feels earned at the end. Minor weakness: the intellect rarely misfires; struggle costs are mostly emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s want (reanimate a shared dream with Lir) is clear and drives concrete choices—defying the lab, drumming despite warnings. Interiority is embodied through tactile sound and the lagoon; hope and doubt coexist in the final beat. The rebellious trait meaningfully constrains her choices, though the consequence of defiance remains mostly emotional rather than situational. A sharper on‑page cost beyond risk warnings could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation and competencies are clear and specific, and his micro-choices (coin flips, whispered routes, quiet interventions) align with them. Interiority skews declarative (“His motivation burned deep”) rather than dramatized under stress, and there’s little contradictory impulse on the page. Status dynamics with Marcus are legible and shift from taunt to quiet triumph. Cost to Elias remains muted, limiting depth of change.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive and internal conflict are clear and embodied—her “half‑spoken secret” and the physical pull toward confession feel lived. The guardian’s silence and choice to teach through demonstration sharpen her dilemma without coercion. The final whispered confession earns its turn, though the guardian’s stated intent risks slight over‑explanation. Contradictory impulses (urge to confess vs. fear) act simultaneously on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive is clear and particular—seed doubt through a quiet, chess-like campaign—and his choices align with that aim. Interiority is evocative but largely unconflicted; he rarely wavers or pays a personal emotional price beyond fatigue implied by the orb dimming. Competence is high with little friction, which blunts intensity. Still, specific reactions to the orb, grotto, and students’ “hearing” give him an identifiable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive—freedom beyond enforced peace—reads vivid and coherent, and her contradiction (yearning for wildness while tethered to Marek) acts in scene. The scrimshaw-mediated confrontations show credible micro-choices (“Go then,” paired with his visible hurt) that force a costed decision. Emotional embodiment is specific (dock work, water at ankles), not label-only. Minor idealization smooths struggle, but the cost is still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradiction—blank face versus florid narration, helper versus informer—is alive in-scene and motivates his tactics with Mira. Interiority is mostly implied through action and objects (knife, bouquet) rather than deep thought, but the moral ambiguity reads specific, not generic. Mira functions as pressure rather than a full counterforce, which keeps the crucible narrow. The final endurance feels earned, with cost acknowledged in “moral weight… lingering.”

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—Elias wants to test the once‑sacred boundary by paraphrasing the incantation—and his actions align. Interiority carries a distinct sensibility (“poet of ephemeral shades”), and embodied beats (hum as chest-tremor, warmth of quartz) reveal him. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he doesn’t wrestle with fear or scruple against risk. The change at the end reads as fulfillment rather than a hard trade‑off, keeping cost light.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clean and character‑specific: a colorblind painter seeks beauty in imperfection and tests it under pressure. Micro‑choices (the added fern frond, the rapid rearrangement to revoke) reveal “innocent cunning” without hand‑waving. The horror at garish clashes when color arrives gives a credible, embodied contradiction. Some interiority leans conceptual rather than somatic, slightly softening peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her micro-choices (which questions to pose, how to ring) align with it. Interiority is present but skews more declarative insight than contradictory impulse; she rarely conflicts with herself beyond gentle doubt. The cost registers via the lamp lens cracking and her trembling voice, but struggle is largely smooth and competence-protected. Still, the final repricing feels earned by her consistent method.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivations are clear—Elias’s grief-charged mission and Lira’s need for redemption—but interiority leans summary-lyric over embodied contradiction. The key choice (Lira accepting the tattoo) reads credible yet almost frictionless, with limited ambivalence on the page. Elias’s Earned Stasis at the end (continuing the mission with a cost) works but lacks a sharp on-page micro-tradeoff. Strong object-reactions (locket, vellum) hint at depth that could be further dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (mapping cultural patterns) is consistent and drives her choices, and Marcus’s guilt provides a plausible reason to seek her. However, interior conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized, with few micro-choices under pressure. The emotional cost is modest: Marcus leaves “lighter,” but the scene doesn’t force a hard tradeoff. Distinctive details (onyx-ink, inherited craft) individualize them without fully testing their flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, compelling motivation (forbidden knowledge) drives concrete choices; embodied action (erratic dance, tears beneath veil) gives texture. The internal contradiction—ecstasy of discovery against grief at lost innocence—operates in scene, not just summary. Minor abstraction remains in places (“end of innocence”) but is grounded by the body at peak beats. Final endurance/acceptance reads earned with visible cost (collapse, altered self-conception).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation (“preserve the shape of hope”) drives every choice, and her discovery that the shadow is tied to her past adds credible internal pressure. Interiority is specific—“sharp-eyed dusk noticer,” “softly deliberate”—and actions align with those traits. The confrontation with her own regret at the end provides an earned cost. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but could sharpen further under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear, specific motivation—rebuilding purpose without hardening—drives concrete micro‑choices (peeling maps, crossing out journal entries, feeding the chameleon). The internal contradiction (compassion vs. self‑respect) is credible and enacted, not merely stated. A few on‑the‑nose lines (“Compassion had blinded him”) blunt the nuance. The final stance (question more, keep helping) feels earned with a modest but felt cost: relinquishing naive trust.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive to “learn to read the stories in scars” is clear and credibly rooted in her history as a closure seeker. The contradictory pull—pursuing closure while reopening wounds—operates on the page and culminates in a costly choice. Micro‑choices (flipping the hourglass, committing to “tunnel”) align with motive. A touch of tidy self‑awareness near the end softens the ambiguity but doesn’t break credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistently pursued, and the choice to read the film and then carry its lesson outward aligns with her motive. However, the piece leans lyrical over dramatized micro‑choices, so contradictory impulses and embodied cost remain soft. The final renunciation of “goodbyes” in favor of “new beginnings” is credible but lightly priced on the page. Still, her perception and actions reveal a distinct, particular inner life.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: she seeks to free stifled creativity and chooses a method to do so. Interiority is vivid though archetypal, with limited contradictory impulses in-scene beyond fear vs desire. Micro-choices (raising the sextant, continuing through the meteor barrage) align with motive. The change feels earned but the cost is mostly retrospective (“years of mundane chains”) rather than sharply felt in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—“to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners”—is clear and enacted through his decision to charm the Archive and to carry the reawakened clock. His dreamless vigilance reads as character‑particular and consistent. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he faces little pushback or doubt in the moment, yielding a mostly unopposed execution of will. The cost (endless vigils) is present but lightly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias seeks the “wild frontier” of his mind—and his choices (following the wind, using the gear) align. Interiority is textured but largely unopposed; we don’t see contradictory impulses resisting the goal. The change at the end reads earned if gentle: a release of rigid doctrines and acceptance of the frontier. The felt cost is modest (relinquishing the charged gear, tears) but present.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and steady, and key micro‑choices (offering the fear‑scrap, accepting indirect routes, boarding) align with it. Interiority is evocative but skews archetypal, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The guides function as presences more than pressures, though their gentle insistence frames her choices. The cost of change is present but soft‑focused, more symbolic than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific interiority ties guilt to embodied detail (tingling nerves, gestures), and micro-choices (wandering, investigating the stain, deciding to stay) align with motive. The internal contradiction—yearning for safety vs. need to atone—operates on the page. Slight dock for a few declarative insights that edge toward thesis rather than showing contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s motive and tactics are clear and consistent, with tactile touches like the ink stains grounding her resolve. However, interior contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers—so her endurance costs feel conceptual more than embodied. The library’s no‑violence constraint usefully channels her choices into subtlety. The final acceptance of ongoing vigil registers as an earned stasis but with limited personal price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s solitary discipline, tactile tapping habit, and grief-tinged persistence create a credible, specific interior life under pressure. Her micro-choices—pulling the torn atlas, assembling fragments, translating Morse—align with her goal. The emotional cost (tears at the father’s confession) lands, though the internal contradiction (love of sea vs inherited complicity) could surface a shade earlier in scene. Overall, her motivation is clear and escalates toward an earned, quiet resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s drive to “discover meaning in the mess” is clear and consistent, with embodied choices (barefoot, climbing, pressing palms). However, internal contradiction is minimal—she encounters little doubt or friction—and the vision‑epiphany tidily resolves without felt emotional cost. “Awkwardly confident” is stated rather than stress‑tested. The final stance reads earned but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and specific, and her actions align with it across the beats (decoding, diving, unsealing). Interiority is present but largely declarative; we see resolve more than contradictory impulses under pressure. The elders’ opposition is mostly off‑page, softening felt cost. Still, her embodied choice against tradition lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’ motivation is clear and particular—grounding hope in tangible care—and his internal conflict is embodied through the freeze, tremor, and the “burning” photograph. The botany competence reads lived-in and informs his tactics. “Somatic markers” edges toward clinical label-speak but is quickly embodied by physical cues and choice, keeping the moment credible. The final renunciation of paralysis in favor of steady tending feels earned with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s despair-to-agency progression is motivated by concrete pressures (walls closing, sea raging) and personal flaw (his fixation on capturing “essence”). His micro-choices—picking up the broken tarot box, choosing descent, committing to “redesign”—align with his artist’s temperament. Contradictory impulses (surrender vs. salvage) are dramatized through the repeated rhetorical questions. The lingering “luminescent ache” preserves cost and avoids a neat emotional reset.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—his drive to understand crisis time and the serene anger from sabotage. Interiority is embodied (sensitivity to light, intuition guiding the ink experiment), and choices track to traits. However, struggle is minimal; he encounters little resistance and pays almost no visible price. The “consciously wild” contradiction is present but not pressure‑tested against a meaningful counter‑impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and inner split are clear and embodied (trembling hands, breath fogging), and her decisive act grows plausibly from her need to protect vs. expose. The contradiction is live in scene, not just declared, and resolves into action. The cost is mostly conceptual/implied rather than felt on her body or relationships on the page, limiting peak impact. A touch of label‑speak (“bravely conflicted,” “motivation burned clear”) flattens nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s pacifist resolve and “senseless perception” cohere into motivated choices (repurposing the sandbag into a sheath, vowing to encase violence). Interiority is specific to her vocation and history with her father, with embodied action (pruning, whispering to roses) revealing values. Internal contradiction is present but gentle—steadfast pacifism under threat rather than sharp ambivalence—limiting peak complexity. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned with a modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eron’s motive and temperament are crisp and consistent, and his tactics (silence, zigzagging, the cast, the release) align with that persona. Interiority is restrained to a fault—“His heart stirred, but he remained composed” signals conflict but doesn’t deepen it. The renunciation (releasing the echo) reads earned but the felt cost is modest. Strong competence with little genuine struggle limits depth at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to confront the accusation is coherent and rooted in her observant nature and family legacy. Her micro‑choices (devising the contradiction argument, inviting the journalist, committing it to a letter) align with motive. Internal tension between protecting the name and exposing truth is present but mostly conceptual, not under direct interpersonal pressure. Cost is implied rather than felt viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motive is clear and consistent, and her choices (prying open the desk, tethering with amber, tattooing herself) align under pressure. Interiority is present but could show more simultaneous contradictory impulses beyond remorse and resolve. The self‑tattoo beat nicely externalizes her internal cost. The forgiveness resolution lands but edges toward tidy, reducing lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (“to discover meaning in the mess”) is clear and enacted through concrete choices: making the mandala and interjecting. Her social perceptiveness is dramatized in the readings of others’ body language and the mapped “connections.” Internal contradiction is light—she moves smoothly from perception to action—so the cost of her shift is modest. Still, the final discovery of meaning lands credibly via action rather than declarative insight.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—mercy as revolution—is clear, consistent, and sharpened by his admission that it’s “aberrant” and perhaps foolish. His retrocognitive flashes complicate action credibly, especially the origin vision that reweights his choice. Interiority is concrete (tactile tracing of chips like braille) and particular. The cost to him remains more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the arc’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied through synesthesia, and her micro-choices (sneaking in, following the rustle, touching the coin) align with her despair-turned-possibility arc. The relationship with Silas functions as a crucible, with his “See how possibilities linger” pushing her into contact with the coin. Internal contradiction (seeking solace or oblivion) is present but mostly asserted rather than tested under sharper pressure. The change at dawn reads earned if gentle, with limited visible cost beyond bittersweet nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Alex’s “affectionate skeptic” contradiction is vivid and drives choices: he doubts the crystal and pill yet embraces Mia and devises a method to meet her. Interiority is embodied (tingling palms, spine chill) and the overwhelm from “fractally precise” impressions creates credible pressure. His final softening is earned—not an erasure but a reconfiguration with emotional cost (vulnerability). Minor safety: Mia’s pressure is gentle; a sharper on‑page push from her could have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motive and a distinct professional lens; embodied emotion via the heat‑map is effective. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she meets little resistance, so we learn less under pressure. The choices (venturing alone, scanning, following) align with motive but incur scant visible cost. Strong character particularity without a crucible to test it.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eland’s motive—recasting prophecy through shared wisdom—is clear and consistently enacted via the jar and buttons. Interiority is specific (youth “chasing prophecies that bound rather than freed”) but conflict is mostly one‑sided conviction rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied detail (calloused hands, trembling) grounds emotion. The final choice (turning the massive hourglass) is earned, though the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, coherent motivation (repair the broken network) and a few grounded micro-choices (waiting, choosing the snow method, handing over the film). The interiority is steady but a touch generic at times; competing impulses (guilt, fear, hope) are more stated than embodied. The relationship pressure with Mira is quiet and credible but underexploited. The final act—entrusting the microfilm—shows value hierarchy, though the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s patient, methodical temperament and goal are clear, and his micro‑choices (waiting, pricking the parchment, privileging protection over gain) align with them. The internal tension between inherited greed/vengeance and his distilled ethic is present but underplayed—never quite dramatized as a live temptation on the page. Embodied perception (rain ticks, fog, smell of damp) does ground emotion credibly. The final renunciation feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s drive to understand endurance is clear and embodied through tactile choices (placing the glass, reading sun and smoke, mending comb). The zen/curiosity tension is present but not deeply conflicted, keeping the emotional cost modest. Micro‑choices feel character‑specific and align with his craft. The ending renunciation (leaving) is earned but underplayed in felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—guarding fragile lives by redirecting moonlight—is clear and consistently enacted through precise, careful choices. Interiority is present and embodied (the exposure on open water, the chill, the measured adjustments), though internal contradiction is mild. “Wistfully pragmatic” shows in action rather than label alone. The closing endurance/renewal beats feel earned, if low‑drama.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to metabolize loneliness into independence via contact with spectral Aetherwings—is clear and consistent. Interiority is embodied through the “brittle awakenings,” hum through bone, and the choice to persist despite fragility. Contradiction (yearning to reconnect vs. the risk of shattering) surfaces but remains tidy, with limited mess or moral ambiguity. The final renunciation is earned but leans cleanly declarative rather than painfully conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive (to “rejoin” by risking his own words) is clear and aligns with his keeper‑of‑secrets flaw. Interiority is evocative but mostly summarized; contradictory impulses in-scene are muted until Mira appears. His key action—building the installation and finally handing Mira a scroll—tracks, but the emotional cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally. The reunion leans on recognition rather than pressure that forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—outwit the tricksters to protect a fracturing community—and her micro-choices (calibration, masking the broadcast) align under pressure. The “cautiously hopeful” contradiction is present on the page and informs her restraint. However, internal conflict remains modest; competence outpaces visible doubt or cost. The ending’s vigilance implies price, but we don’t feel a sharp personal cost in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s fear/drive contradiction is concrete—he checks escape routes while forcing himself to the pedestal—and his embodied claustrophobia (breath quickening, walls “inching closer”) reads true under pressure. His agency (choosing to align and press the compass point) fits his “prudently adventurous” trait. The internal shift at the end (claustrophobia receding, sorrow lingering) is earned by on‑page events. Cost is present but light, more elegiac than scarring.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s prosopagnosia and cultivated detachment convincingly drive his method and choices, and the ribbon engages a credible curiosity. His internal shift toward empathy lands, but it’s largely told and tidy rather than pressured into being on the page. Micro-choices exist (pocketing the ribbon, returning to the quarry, submitting the portrait), yet struggle is smoothed by summary. Emotional contradiction (detachment vs. awakening) is present but under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive to redeem Harlan is clear and consistent, and her nervously confident push against “spongey dread” reads as a live contradiction. Micro-choices—retrieving the nail, aligning runes, deciding to sail—reveal values under pressure. Interiority is image-led rather than diagnostic, with credible tremor and resolve. A slight tendency to state motive (“honoring Harlan…”) trims edge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motive—turning “never” into possibility—is clear and expressed through tactile choices (picking up the flake, aligning it, playing the fiddle). Interiority is specific (“luminous disbelief”) and embodied via objects rather than labels. However, contradictory impulses are muted; he seldom struggles on‑page beyond wonder and resolve. The vow at the end reads earned but low‑cost, leaning more toward poise than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives are clear and specific—escape the robber’s legacy by understanding loops—and his nonviolent boundary tactic aligns with his “polished calm.” The sacrifice of the cherished bills under pressure reveals character through action. However, some interior insight is told rather than dramatized, and the final realization risks neatness. Still, micro-choices (not confronting Victor; using symbols) feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her profession informs her tactics. However, there’s little contradictory impulse—she moves from receipt of the telegram to help without friction—so change bears limited cost. Embodied detail (telegraph’s daylily, variable stars as anchor) grounds her emotion. The relationship with Thorne reconfigures by the end, but his presence is largely visionary.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elowen’s guardedness versus her “warlike serenity” produces credible contradictory impulses, and her micro‑choices (stepping deeper, choosing the fungi path, planting the seed) align with motive. The internal shift—allowing her own barriers to unbend—feels earned by the lake’s pressure. Emotions are embodied through cold water, lashing branches, acidic fruit. A touch of label‑speak (“attribute of finding lost things”) softens the edge of the otherwise lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive (“purposefully curious”) is dramatized in her choice to press the clipping into her scar and to sever her roots despite existential risk. Interiority is embodied through the scar pain/pleasure and the root-tether constraint, with credible conflicting impulses (anxious elation vs dread). The change—unbinding—feels earned by prior causality. Slight distance remains: blind spots and messy error aren’t deeply mined beyond the single risk calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent—reckless idealism paired with a healing drive—and her key choice (accepting the price) aligns with those traits. Interiority is embodied through sensory focus and ritual acts rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is mild; she scarcely wavers, so the cost is accepted without much visible struggle beyond a “tremor.” The “fiercely gentle” quality does influence how she faces the Keeper but could test her values under sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jack’s contradictory impulses—“confidently uncertain,” armoring with facts while being pierced by memory—are clear and embodied in how he handles the box and the grille cloth. His desire and shame from the TV fiasco plausibly drive him to this out-of-the-way gig and the choice to buy the scrap. The final decision to start a new venture tracks, but the cost feels lightly handled and a touch tidy. Some moments lapse into labeled emotion rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and organically rooted in grief and curiosity; his “kindly methodical” trait governs tactics (planting, waiting, incanting). Internal contradiction (ambition vs acceptance) is present but soft; the path to reconnection faces little resistance. Reactions to key objects (seed, soil, fruit) reveal character. The resolution edges tidy, with limited cost beyond relinquishing visible apparition for inner presence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—preserve wonder—and his moon‑phase introspection colors tactics at the forge. Micro‑choices (wading, gathering, intoning acceptance) align with character. Internal conflict is more stated than tested; he rarely struggles or pays a visible cost. The phase‑shift trait hints at contradiction but isn’t pressed into a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s guarded pragmatism and grief are clear, and his “heartbeat of a hesitation” sets a credible internal crucible. The choice to perform the ritual reads motivated by accumulated loss and longing. The turn borders on tidy, with the magic mechanism doing heavy lifting, but embodied details (cool shell, warming pearl) keep it grounded. Some phrasing edges toward abstract (“walls between hearts”), slightly smoothing true messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt-driven quest and the choice to go off medication create a coherent, felt motivation with embodied beats (trembling fingers, handling the accordion). His “daringly methodical” bent appears in map-work and risk-taking. The epiphany is a touch declared (“The insight hit him”), trimming complexity. Contradictory impulses are present but mild, more reflective than frictional in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to preserve the unspoken) is clear and her caution vs. exuberance tension is dramatized through micro‑choices (methodically pacing the watch, stopping before the second letter). Embodied responses (bated breath, veiled eyes widening) keep emotion on the page. The internal conflict never quite spikes into a hard renunciation with visible pain, but restraint under pressure reads credible. A few explanatory lines (“This was her motivation fulfilled”) dilute specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s want-versus-duty conflict is clear and active, and her micro-choices (coffee ritual, cutting the fern, drawing the bow) align with that pressure. The interiority stays character-specific via tactile rituals, though it leans summary-lyric rather than embodied contradiction at peak beats. The cost—accepting a reshaped life within the empire rather than pure freedom—lands but feels cushioned. Still, actions proceed credibly from her motives without safety hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve a final spark—is clear and consistently enacted through precise, ritualized choices. Interiority is present in her “quiet rebellion” and end‑beat self‑question, though contradictory impulses under pressure are muted by her competence. The body work (placing the chip, sifting patterns) aligns with motive and reveals character. The cost rests more on burden carried than on a contested decision in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—care, forgiveness, and the quest for contentment—and her choices (climb, ritual, sharing insight) align with them. Interiority is present but largely declarative, with little simultaneous contradiction under pressure. The “kindly decisive” trait is shown in action, though the emotional price paid to act isn’t deeply felt on the page. Lir functions more as catalyst than pressure, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s “sincerely insincere” persona rubs against a surfacing vulnerability, and Mara’s moral rigidity meets a credible impulse to change. Micro‑choices (climb, listen, don the cloak, unhook the logbook) track motive to action. Some feelings are labeled in abstract terms (“welcome nuance into certainty”), softening the lived texture. The final mutual shift is earned, though a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—teaching through withholding—is clear and enacted, with a mild internal tension between protection and disclosure. Lir’s frustration provides some interpersonal pressure and registers a small power dynamic shift. Interiority skews declarative at times (“to teach you properly”) rather than embodied. The final reveal credibly reconfigures their relationship without grand cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in duty: he must learn to navigate without moving to restore the canyon’s pulse. Interiority is present through tactile focus on the arrowhead and the birds, but contradictory impulses are minimal; he rarely wavers from resolve. Embodied emotion appears in weathered skin, dust, and patience rather than volatile feeling. The final stance (charged poise, hope through stillness) reads earned, though the felt cost remains mostly historical and implied.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s desire “to find the sacred in the simple” is clear and consistently enacted through his choice to mist walk and unstrap the keystone. Interiority is present but light on contradiction; fear, doubt, or competing impulses seldom complicate his resolve. Embodied detail (cold, numb fingers) grounds emotion, though the struggle feels relatively frictionless. The change—quiet awe and tears—lands, but with minimal on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific, and his choices (abandoning the pole, diving, claiming the tag, vowing) align with it. Interiority is textured through synesthetic hints, but internal contradiction and cost are light—he wants, seeks, finds, with little friction. The occupational detail (lamplighter) pays off in the final reprise but doesn’t force a hard trade‑off. The emotional change reads as credible but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to align and catalyze rebirth) is clear and drives concrete micro‑choices: casting lots, focusing on the eastern burst, and refining the distillation. The internal tension—quiet enthusiasm versus stellar doubt—registers and evolves into harnessed doubt. Embodiment is present (“hands trembled,” “steadying her breath”) but remains mostly lyric-abstract rather than tactile under peak stress. The change at the end (accepting doubt as fuel) feels earned, though the on‑page cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and specific—he seeks to name fears to transmute grief—and actions align (placing the atlas, adjusting mirrors, naming crystals). The inner contradiction (enforcer of sacrifice vs lover) is present but not deeply dramatized in on‑page push‑pull. Micro‑choices under pressure occur but remain low‑friction. The final endurance/renunciation (solace through naming) is credible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—restore balance via the bell—and the “lukewarm” limitation shapes tactics (heating the metal “just enough”). Interiority holds an effective contradiction: earnest naiveté vs. brittle devotion. Embodied stress (sweat, trembling, counting under pressure) grounds emotion. The concluding transformation (“devotion held, fortified by success”) risks being told rather than earned, but enough groundwork precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s vocation and “precisely humane” ethic ground clear motive, and the photos progressively pry open his buried grief into a choice to share. Interiority is specific (callused fingers, the ache at the riverbank) rather than generic. Contradictory impulses—duty-bound vigilance vs. the tug of private pain—coexist credibly. The closing renunciation of isolation feels earned by the breadcrumbed recognitions.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—to reconcile logic and intuition—reads coherent and specific, with embodied contradictions (calculations vs. trusting the murmuration). Her sentimental streak (pressed petals, the single tear) informs the decisive act. However, she meets minimal resistance; competence is high and struggle modest, so the cost feels light. The change lands, but with limited ambiguity or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserving communal trust under pressure—is clear and consistently drives her choices. Embodied interiority through the parachute buckle and muscle memory grounds her competence. However, internal contradiction is light; doubt and fear never notably deform her actions, keeping the arc comfortably competent rather than fraught. The final stance (calm broadcast, plan enacted) feels earned but low on visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kai’s aim to overcome numbness and prove fitness is clear and drives choices under pressure; his ice-versus-fire contradiction is dramatized rather than told. The custody trial forces concrete action (using the blade, choosing unity). Emotional return at the end is earned, though recovery lands a touch tidily. The clone provides relational pressure that sharpens Kai’s internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (protecting his creative haven and struggling business) is clear and consistent, and his receptivity guides his choices. Interiority is credible if somewhat tidy; he entertains multiple possibilities without much contradiction or friction. The seed catalyzes concrete micro‑choices (pocketing it, deciding to consult a botanist, committing to a new room). The emotional cost remains muted; we don’t see a live trade‑off or risk felt on the page beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive to restore family laughter is clear and consistent, and his nightly ritual provides embodied motive. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he reads more saintly than humanly conflicted—so the arc lacks a sharper costed choice. Micro‑choices (aiming at fissures, persistent tugs) are present but not deeply pressured. The earned stasis at the end aligns with his nature but could carry heavier ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular (dimensionally homesick guardian seeking peace through befriending uncertainty). The interiority is vivid and embodied (“cold to seep into its bones,” pendant warming) though occasionally abstracted into aphorism (“waiting was not passivity”). Micro‑choices (to wait, to focus on the pendant, to interiorize the garden) align with motive and reveal values. The change at the end—earned stasis toward fragile peace—feels credible but low‑risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive (breaking the curse) is clear and actions align with motives across iterative trials. Interiority is textured and embodied (“heavy weight pressing on his chest,” sweat, hammer), though labels like “stoically sensitive” verge on told rather than shown. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) operate in scene and culminate credibly in the final pour of essence. The epiphany skews slightly neat, but prior failures earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal and professional mindset are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (climb, calibrate, discard assumptions) align with motive. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she already believes in beginnings inside endings, so the arc is more confirmation than change. Embodied detail (boots scraping, the fragment’s hum) grounds emotion, but cost remains subtle. The mentor loss informs motive but doesn’t force a fraught trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias’s optimism drives him to act—but internal contradiction is minimal, leaving little felt cost to his choices. His competence undercuts pressure; he encounters few setbacks. Embodied emotion appears (“heart pounding”) yet remains uniformly buoyant. The final endurance/change is credible but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive is clear and specific—engineering a tangible “texture of connection” to his dead sister—and his actions align with that motive. Interiority is image-led and character-coherent, though internal contradiction is light; he rarely struggles against himself, operating with near-total competence. The felt cost lands in the spent thread and serene acceptance. A sharper moment of hesitation or risk would have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in character: a cautious instructor driven to unlock starlight navigation. Interiority feels specific (the chain link as tether, grief for surface ancestors) and actions align with traits. Internal conflict is present but mild—“balanced curiosity” slows him and keeps triumph in check rather than forcing a sharp trade‑off. The closing vow reads earned, though the cost remains largely emotional rather than pressured by on‑page opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—protecting vulnerable voices—tracks cleanly from the atrium to the cottage, with the pivot from her own quest to the elderly woman showing character in action. The internal contradiction (her own heartache vs. aiding another) is present but lightly dramatized, with low felt cost. Embodied emotion (trembling fingers, mist‑clung coat) supports her choices, though some feelings are told. The final endurance/renunciation is credible but under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alex’s motivation (“to stand by the unremembered”) is clear and consistently tested through his claustrophobia and phase-by-phase choices. The embodied stress in the flooded tunnel and steam antechamber grounds interior conflict in action. Minor softness: he rarely wavers once committed, so contradictory impulses surface briefly rather than compounding into a sharper moral trade-off. The final endurance feels earned with a tangible cost but not transformative beyond relief and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—escaping bureaucratic erasure and seeking Elara’s wisdom—and his heartbeat counting embodies anxiety under pressure. Micro‑choices (placing the shard, tracing ink, scanning) align with his values and fear. Internal contradiction—terror of non‑existence versus the courage to resurrect Elara—registers but resolves a bit tidily. The final calming beat feels earned, though the cost remains primarily internal and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and sustained—preserve a dying tactile language—but internal contradiction is minimal, with fear of the tunnel’s madness only briefly felt. His micro‑choices (entering, placing the diamond, aligning to birds) align with motive and reveal character. Emotional embodiment via “copper‑veined” imagery is vivid but leans emblematic over conflicted. A small sense of cost lands in the residual thrumming, but the trial feels largely controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—bitterness alchemized into a cosmic joke—is clear and consistently drives her actions, especially the choice to dial and confess. Interiority is concrete (arrowhead warmth, floating soil, frostbitten hope), though a few labels (“bitterness festered”) lean tell-y. The undercover angle credibly informs her tactics. The metamorphosis feels earned and carries a cost (foreclosing her human life/cover), even if the emotional struggle resolves swiftly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—to reawaken beauty—drives concrete action, and her fear of acting from the sky‑bridge provides a credible internal brake. The locust shell ties her interior desire to an external object, and her choice to intensify playing reads earned. However, ambivalence dissolves quickly once the plan works; the cost to her is slight. Interiority is vivid but leans declarative (“She understood now”), muting contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive and ethos (“respectfully rebellious”) are clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices under pressure (tipping his hat, scanning for spies, timing the storm release) align with them. Interiority is mostly externalized through action and motif rather than deep contradiction; he reads competent with little on‑page inner conflict. The hollow‑eyed woman adds a relational pressure point that humanizes his aim. The ending earns an endurance stance more than a transformative change, with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives (devotion to craft, quiet curiosity) are consistent and drive action from the wrong turn to picking up the halo fragment and attempting song. Interiority is vivid via tactile responses to setting, but contradictory impulses are light; he rarely struggles against a counter‑urge. The decisive change to singing feels earned by the scene’s build. Emotional cost is implied (identity shift), not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is specific and consistent, and her actions align with it through concrete micro-choices (slipping to the alcove, aligning scarf to chalked curves). Interiority is textured and embodied (“the scarf’s threads seemed to respond”), but internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little resistance beyond solitude. Emotional progression is steady rather than pressured. The closing endurance—choosing solitude as her access point—reads as earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive—to reclaim a “runaway dream”—is clear and consistently enacted through finding the palette, preparing the camera, and sailing at dawn. Interiority is lyrical and specific to her vocation and loss, though it leans abstract (“luminous absence”) more than embodied at peak beats. Contradictory impulses are faint; she rarely hesitates or missteps under pressure. The final shift reads earned but with limited on‑page struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—freeing Mira’s shelved idea to mend his own rift—and his micro-choices (waiting for the star, offering the hair) align under pressure. Interiority is present but often abstract; contradictory impulses surface lightly (hesitation vs. bold action) without deep friction. The cost—relinquishing the last tangible remnant of Mira—reads, though it’s handled gently. He remains somewhat archetypal, limiting the depth of internal conflict at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation to reclaim her stolen memories is clear and consistent, and her methodical detection tactic grows credibly from her hands-on curiosity. Interiority is specific enough to feel lived-in, though contradictory impulses (fear vs. drive) are muted, making the peak choice feel low-risk. The decades-long cost is evocative but mostly conceptual at the climax. Strong, but not searing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—quietly forging resilience through combative tenderness—is clear and enacted through specific choices (ordering, coaxing, tea‑reading, the shadow demonstration). Kael’s arc from defiance to engaged agency reads, but the shift feels swift with limited interior contradiction on the page. The mirrored nervous backward-walking adds a smart behavioral echo, hinting at influence without speechifying. The final change is earned, if a touch easy, with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she faces little resistance and exhibits minimal internal contradiction. Her competence goes untested; the ritual proceeds without doubt, misstep, or cost. Interiority is largely declarative (“insatiably creative”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The closing contentment lands, but without a trade-off that reveals new facets of character.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (grounding the spirits) is clear and deepened by her guilt and lineage, and her micro-choices (knot by knot, confession by confession) align with rising pressure. The internal contradiction—competence undercut by fear of unleashing unrest—reads credibly and surfaces at the climax when she admits her family’s role. Embodied perception (“storm seen through clear glass,” threads resisting) keeps emotion lived-in rather than labeled. The only soft note is how neatly her confession resolves guilt without lingering complication.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives (methodical curiosity, empathetic listening to silence) are clear and drive his tactics, and his micro-choices (silent projection, pausing, aligning the torn map) reveal him under pressure. The “shielded yet open” stance hints at contradiction, though the internal conflict never bites hard. Emotional embodiment is present but skews abstract at peaks. The final “mending” choice is motivated, if its cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s grief‑driven, methodical pursuit is clear, and his micro‑choices (careful manipulation, decoding, opening the note) align with a quietly analytic temperament. The contradiction between control and surrender surfaces credibly in the snow‑globe sequence. His epiphany trends slightly tidy (“I see it now”), but it’s earned by specific on‑page discovery. The cost—accepting equilibrium instead of clinging—registers without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elowen’s motive—to be heard and freed—is clear and embodied in his encoding act, but his interior conflict is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Lira’s swift arrival and instinctive decoding read convenient and underdeveloped as character pressure. The “seldom-heard” aspect gains poignancy through his encoded plea, yet the liberation comes too easily to reveal deeper flaws or contradictions. Strong, but not searching.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent—curiosity as a means to find “joy beneath anguish”—and they drive concrete micro‑choices (prying out the diary, donning the goggles, refusing the burn ritual). The internal tension between honoring the diarist’s instruction and preserving the artifact registers, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. Embodied touches (numb fingers, misting eyes) keep him grounded but could deepen under pressure. Overall, a credible, quietly transformative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation is precise and consistent—grief transmuted into a need to prove absence retains imprint—and his choices (the ritual of emotional taxonomy, focusing on the void) align with it. Embodied emotion lands (the creak of wicker, the cool brass, tears on the reveal). Internal contradiction exists (rage at the “string’s betrayal” versus devotion and yearning for peace) but remains tidy rather than fully contended on the page. The closing shift to “quiet peace” is earned but a touch frictionless, with little visible cost beyond tears.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive—to paint a sky that rebels against the limits of her face blindness—is clear and consistently dramatized. The fractal coin forces a credible internal conflict as recursion mirrors her perceptual constraint. Her micro‑choices (to adopt the coin’s method, persist under pressure, then return the coin) align with character and cost. One line (“discovering limits”) states the theme outright, slightly blunting interiority’s subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motivation and habits are clear and consistent, and his “sociable isolation” adds texture. Micro‑choices—brushing dust, aligning board irregularities with flock turns, consulting the phrasebook—reveal character competently. However, contradictory impulses are muted and there’s little felt cost or risk to complicate his diligence. The closing acceptance carries warmth but not a sacrifice that redefines him.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s want is clear and embodied—she seeks “the rhythm of repair” and takes concrete actions (assembling gears, uncapping the core). The interiority is particular and sensorially grounded (salt, frost, mirrors), though internal contradiction remains gentle (yearning vs. cost) rather than pressured. The success comes too smoothly, limiting felt struggle. Still, her choices align cleanly with motive and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motives are clear (Elara’s altruism; Mara’s guarded pragmatism; Jax’s doubt), but interiority is summarized rather than dramatized. The trust shift hinges on “strangely trustworthy” more than embodied, contradictory impulses. Relationships function but don’t notably change under pressure beyond a tidy unification. The farewell carries feeling, yet the cost for characters is light.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation and embodied interiority (“beautifully flawed hands,” trembling at the pane) anchor Elias. However, internal contradiction is muted; the ritual proceeds with mastery and little on‑page struggle. The acceptance of delay‑not‑aversion registers as cost but doesn’t force a wrenching trade‑off. Strong presence, limited friction.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s contradiction—wanting to flee yet compelled to guide—drives action and reads credibly under pressure. Her “offhandedly exact” mind shows in micro-choices (“Shift left by three degrees”) that align with motive. The endurance at the end (returning to duty, nut spent) is an earned stasis with cost. Emotion is more textured than deep; some embodiment trends abstract but remains specific enough.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motives are clear and character‑specific, and her professional lens credibly drives her choices. Interiority is textured (foam rhythms, polymer analogies), though impulses rarely conflict on the page. The reconciliation feels a touch tidy, with little visible risk or backsliding under pressure. Still, the choice to craft and present the sculpture reads earned by prior perception and regret.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to locate the origin of stories—drives each choice from opening the vial to sacrificing her vendor identity. The internal tension between shopkeeper and seeker sharpens credibly at the guarded nexus. Emotional texture skews conceptual over embodied, but remains coherent. The renunciation reads earned and costs her both identity and tool.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, urgent motivation rooted in a specific betrayal drives concrete choices, and the embodied cost of absorption reads on the page. Interiority is particular to his vocation (tasting memories like a broth), which personalizes the magic. However, contradictory impulses surface only lightly—he rarely hesitates or resists—so the internal struggle feels smooth. The final change is credible but a touch tidy for the depth of guilt invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—bridging isolated communities—drives clear choices (repairing the mechanism, organizing farmers). Interiority is lyrical but mostly declarative; contradictory impulses are minimal, so pressure tests feel soft. The tactile attachment to the cuckoo weight reveals character through action. Emotional embodiment skews toward poetic abstraction rather than conflicted specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—he wants to become an “archaeologist of abandoned dreams”—and his choices (holding and angling the mirror, deliberate visualization) align with that drive. Interiority is specific to an engineer’s lexicon, though it edges toward abstraction at times. The father/mentor tensions give credible friction but the resolution feels a touch neat for the pain invoked. Still, the on‑page micro‑choices under pressure read coherent and earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire to preserve and unlock knowledge is clear and consistent, and her “prism‑minded” framing gives her interiority some specificity. She makes micro‑choices under pressure (aligning the doodle, evading tendrils, exploiting inversion). Internal contradiction is light; fear versus obsession is noted but rarely dramatized as a simultaneous pull. The ending offers triumph more than a felt cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in tactile choices (clearing vines, tracing cracks, strumming). Her brief moment of doubt when “nothing happened” gives a small but credible contradiction. The interiority is particular—she reads cracks as crescendos—though “empathy in motion” trends abstract when repeated. The visible cost is mainly emotional (tears, spent focus), modest but present at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motive—seeking beauty in difficulty rather than revenge—is clear and consistently expressed through tactile choices (pressing the dent, sitting in the hum, vowing). Interiority is specific to a chess tutor’s mind, reading the world as board and pause. Contradictory impulses (fear of vulnerability vs desire for redemption) surface credibly in the “translated silences.” The arc is quiet but earned; the cost is emotional rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s pacifism and mission to “catalog the varieties of silence” are clear and embodied through tactile actions and sensory thinking. His emotional throughline—tears at the brother’s pain, refusal to escalate—reads specific rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is light; he rarely struggles against an opposing impulse, so the choice at the end feels more confirmation than rupture. Still, his micro-choices at the dials and his listening ethic credibly earn the final forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—to transmute turmoil into serenity—is clear and embodied through her choices to plant the corpse flower and to endure its stench. Her olfactory sensitivity and journaling practice feel character‑specific rather than generic. The internal contradiction (ambition vs. calm) is present but resolves a bit tidily once the bloom arrives. Still, her micro‑choices under pressure (breathing in the odor, reframing it) credibly earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motive—save her family orchard—drives every action and keeps her choices coherent under time pressure. Interiority is present (heartbeat, nausea, visions of the failing grove) but remains surface-level; we don’t see contradictory impulses complicating key beats. Competence dominates with little visible flaw or self‑conflict. The final resolve feels earned but emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystal clear and embodied in micro‑choices (adjusting the respirator, recalibrating instruments, reorienting the survey after finding the patch). However, interior contradiction is minimal—Mara is highly competent with little visible doubt or cost. The final stance (reporting for prevention) is earned but emotionally cool. Strong professional specificity carries characterization despite the limited inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive is crisply stated and consistent, and her “oscillating repose” registers as a concrete inner texture. However, internal contradiction is light; she executes a planned ritual with little friction beyond mood and timing. Micro‑choices exist (waiting for the precise instant; following the amber sheet), but they don’t expose real competing values. The earned change is endurance/completion more than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive and ritual‑bound micro‑choices are clear and aligned, and the oppressive hush embodies her emotional pressure. The internal cost is felt when the visions force her to relive the ambush and acknowledge her blind spots. However, the “spirits whisper” lessons verge on on‑the‑nose (humility/folly/strength), softening the complexity of her self‑reckoning. The final shift toward alliance feels earned but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is explicit and drives action—Elias seeks to quantify emotion and uses the press and halo to test it. Interiority is textured with contradictory impulses (methodical control versus identity fragmentation), especially when he questions whether sorrow is transposed or self-generated. Micro-choices (setting phrases, pulling the lever again, swapping personalities) align with his aims under pressure. The cost—ongoing fragmentation and a partial renunciation of total solvability—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—coaxing wonder—drives concrete micro‑choices (she stops and gifts the pendant) with an embodied tremor that reads specific. The tension between her jittery fear of imbalance and urge to extend the encounter gives mild interior conflict. Cost is legible: she parts with a precious relic and accepts Thorne’s fading into myth. Secondary character pressure (Kael’s suspicion) is light but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motives (Elara to prove absorption; Marcus to test a fragile worldview) give the scene focus, and their embodied actions align. The “truthful lies” stance adds a credible internal tension for Elara and pressure for Marcus. However, micro-choices under pressure are limited to demonstration and observation; we don’t see a risky decision that exposes a deeper flaw. Emotional progression is believable but remains controlled rather than volatile.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is crystalline and sustained: deliver a message to her lost child even at mortal cost. Micro‑choices—gathering the puzzle edges, threading the amber bead, proceeding as her years unravel—align with that drive. The inner contradiction (grief vs. resolve) is present but not frictional enough on the page to create strong in‑scene push‑pull. More embodied hesitation or competing impulses under pressure could deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elar’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and his methodical choices (descending the shafts, tapping rather than shattering) align with his meek, deliberate nature. However, internal conflict is minimal; he faces no meaningful doubt or opposing impulse on the page. The “cost” he offers—his silence and unspoken fears—remains abstract rather than embodied. The endurance reads credible but low‑friction, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she will risk getting lost to learn the truth about her brother. Sensory‑anchored interiority feels particular to her craft and body. The confrontation with the brother variant lands, but it’s delivered quickly and with limited contradictory impulses on the page. Emotional cost is present but not deeply wrestled through action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s protector drive is clear and enacted under pressure; his grief (wife and child) grounds motive without melodrama. Reticence vs action produces credible tension, and micro-choices (carrying stones up, choosing seven, placing the letter/glass) reveal values. Some traits are labeled (“warmly observant”) but mostly shown. The cost is primarily emotional, not behavioral, but it still reads earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s drive “to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows” is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (ascending, igniting, adjusting facets) align with that motive. The interior contradiction—joy veiled by foreboding—adds texture but seldom forces a costly trade‑off. Emotional embodiment is largely atmospheric rather than visceral. The final acceptance of a charged role lands, but with limited felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive (to learn why some magnetize stories) is clear and acted upon through concrete choices (ascending, using the wing, tracking light). The donor heart adds a credible inner contradiction—curiosity against “iridescent caution”—but these tensions are stated more than strained on the page. Emotional embodiment is vivid (tea tasting of storms, heart syncing) yet the felt cost of the change remains light. The closing renunciation/acceptance (returning to dye with new hues) is earned but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s motive (to learn what trees witness) is clear and drives his choices from investigating the clink to employing the sextant. Interiority is specific—his reverence for “mundane miracles” and tactile labor grounds him—but internal contradiction is mild and risk is low. The healing realization feels earned by work done on the page, though the visible cost is mostly fatigue and long obsession rather than a sharper trade‑off. The final renunciation is quiet—he returns to maintenance with peace—which reads credible, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive to rekindle the realm is clear and consistently embodied through ritual choices (songs, swaddling, using the mica window). Interiority is present but largely filtered via lyrical description, with minimal contradictory impulses on the page. The success comes with light on‑page struggle (trembling hands at the end), so the cost feels modest. Still, actions align with motive and culminate in a credible earned release.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, coherent motivation (compassion vs self‑protection) drives concrete choices: he attends, hides, resists revealing himself, and slips the note. Interiority balances urge and restraint well (“urge to reveal… but he held back”), though phrasing leans abstract at times. The earned renunciation at closure reads credible with a felt, if quiet, cost. Minor therapy‑adjacent labels (“keenly empathetic”) slightly flatten specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—to redeem neglect by revealing the sacred in the ordinary—is clear and consistent, and his gentleness both hinders and defines his tactics. The bolder choice to unearth the mound after years of passivity shows credible internal friction. Embodied detail (bread as talisman, soil testing, scents) grounds his interior. The cost of his flaw is acknowledged, though the on‑page price remains more felt than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—salvaging meaning before it vanishes—is clear and consistent with her “gently meticulous” nature, and her micro-choices (tuning, sampling, sealing vials) track under pressure. The ache and urgency are embodied without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is modest; she endures rather than wrestles with competing impulses. Still, the final tremor in her hands registers a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (vengeance disguised as closure) is clear and drives concrete tactics; the watch fob and “truce of hush” filter her perceptions credibly. Internal conflict is present but muted—she rarely wavers between vengeance and caution, so contradiction doesn’t bite under peak pressure. Micro‑choices (vials, haggling, lantern blaze, whispering to the merchant) reveal values through risk management. Thorne is mostly a silhouette, limiting relational heat on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive to understand “why some people carry weather” is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (activating the ring, following taste‑cues, pressing the carrier). The internal contradiction—engineered luminosity and skepticism versus a mystical interface—plays on the page. The cost at closure (softening of doubt, nascent weather in her) is present but mild. The weather‑carrier adds a second pressure briefly but doesn’t deeply test her stance beyond a single exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character-specific motive (uncorking suppressed creativity) drives concrete choices, and interiority shows lived regret without therapy-speak. The “mnemonically gifted, cursed” line verges on label-y, but the charcoal-stained hands, trembling, and tool improvisation embody pressure. Contradictory impulses (fear of damaging the chest vs. need to reclaim self) register in the decision to build an indirect mechanism. The change at the end reads earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional rather than materially foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent, and her doubt-test-commit sequence shows credible micro‑choices under pressure. Interiority is specific (gilding leaves, testing for candor), and the emotional cost lands when she confronts her own lost words. However, internal contradiction is modest and the epiphany leans tidy, with little friction against her core virtue. The absence of relational pressure on the page limits depth of character conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving “the color of wonder”—is clear and consistently drives her choices from discovery to construction to the final wait. Seasonal muteness creates a credible constraint that she adapts to (communicating through touch and design). Internal contradiction is limited; the piece leans serene over conflicted, so the change reads more as earned endurance than a fraught decision. The visible cost is devotion and silence through winter, felt but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—to quell inner static and save the farm—tracks cleanly to concrete choices (miniaturize, then burn). The embodied stakes (error codes, humming circuits, tactile work on the box) are strong, though contradictions under pressure are lightly sketched and she executes the plan with few stumbles. The willingness to damage the dome and leave reads as a credible cost. A touch more friction or misstep in the capture beat would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s motive (to prove listening heals) is clear and aligned with her actions, but her interior conflict is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. She meets little resistance and faces few contradictory impulses while pursuing clues. Secondary characters function more as informative nodes than as pressure sources. The emotional softening at the end lands but feels low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting vulnerability into strength—drives her tactics (journal ciphers, dance-decoding) and aligns with the calm, persistent agency on the page. Interiority is embodied via movement and tactile engagement with dice and water, not diagnostic labels. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses are lightly sketched (terror vs. composure) rather than dramatized in a present-tense pinch. The final choice feels earned, though the felt personal cost at the peak is more inferred than acutely staged.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—his compulsion to locate deleted memories threads every beat and ties to the lost lover. Interiority is concrete (coffee ritual, clutching wildflowers), though internal contradiction (fear of pain vs. need to remember) is more implied than actively contested in-scene. Actions align with motive and build toward the charged final resolve. The emotional cost is gestured at rather than embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—he aims to hush a coded prophecy—but internal conflict is minimal and the path is smooth. Interiority is lyrical yet largely uniform, with few contradictory impulses under pressure. The “tranquil blaze” cooling to embers provides a modest, credible change but with limited felt cost. Competence dominates struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive to “learn the language of old buildings” is clear, persistent, and refracted through doubt, desire, and a charged bond with Mira. His micro-choices—returning weekly, pressing the seal, escalating interrogation—align with motive. Interiority is more summarized than embodied until the rooftop, limiting lived texture under pressure. Still, the relationship functions as crucible and affects his peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “charmed skeptic” contradiction is dramatized (she presses the shell despite doubt, then commits to humming), and her micro‑choices track to a clear goal under a ticking clock. Embodied touches (petals brushing like “phantom fingers”) keep emotion grounded. The transformation to “independence” reads, but the cost feels soft and the struggle resolves a bit smoothly. A touch more friction or misstep at the peak would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation—completing and forgiving an unfinished rebellion—reads specific and consistent, and her micro‑choices (inserting the thorn, aligning the key) reveal a calm, stubborn will under pressure. The interior conflict between resentment and release is present, though some realizations are told rather than dramatized (“accepting that his abandonment was not betrayal”). The final renunciation—letting go of Silas’s ghost—feels earned by the preceding discipline and setting‑charged patience. Minor softness stems from the frictionless ease of her success once she deciphers the key.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to learn why some echo) is clear and drives concrete choices: following the shell, probing Thorne, and finally singing to dismantle his webs. Her perceptiveness informs action (catching his deceit, modulating her tone), though internal contradiction is mild and she rarely falters. The emotional cost—accepting her mother’s “complete” song—is felt but tidy. Thorne offers pressure yet yields quickly, limiting friction that could expose deeper fault lines.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—“to salvage something pure”—is clear and consistent, and her choice to reveal the truth gently aligns with her core trait. Interiority is specific (windows of connection, careful weaving) but her struggle remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized under pressure. The emotional cost for descendants is acknowledged but not embodied on the page. Competence dominates over contradiction, limiting depth of inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation and a lived occupational lens give Elias specificity, and his micro-choices (climbing, following moon paths, whisking, whistling, vowing) align with that. However, internal contradiction is faint; he meets little counter-pressure beyond atmosphere, so his vow reads more as confirmation than contested shift. Embodied emotion comes via tactile acts (froth patterns, damp stone) rather than labels, which helps. The final renunciation of apathy carries cost conceptually but not viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (debunking) drives concrete actions, and the late doubt about exposing the truth adds credible internal tension. Interiority is particular enough (meters dipping, apples unmutated, “heart raced”) but occasionally leans on summary. The choice to pocket the diamond is motivated and revealing. Emotional embodiment could be deeper at the peak; the moral trade‑off registers but not viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive (to “shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (tuning dials, broadcasting, finally stepping onto the cracked portico) align. Internal contradiction (science vs. art vs. the divine) is present but rendered more in diction than dramatized behavior. Embodied emotion is mostly atmospheric rather than visceral, keeping us one step abstracted. The culminating stance crystallization reads earned, though the personal cost is implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is specific and sustained—Elias aims to bridge generations and acts on it by selecting and unsealing the jar. Interiority is clear and embodied through sensory attention to the loft and objects. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are light; there’s little opposing pressure to complicate the choice. The result is moving but low‑friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s duty-versus-grief tension is credible and embodied (wiry engineer, calloused hands, breath syncing to tone). His “logically emotional” trait converts into tactic choice under pressure. The internal cost surfaces at the end, though a few label-y lines (“logically emotional surge”) soften complexity. Secondary figures are thin, but they serve pressure rather than needing depth.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting impatience into strategic patience—drives concrete choices, and her restrained wildness vs. vigilance creates credible internal tension. The line “Impatience is our chain” risks thesis-speak, but the later renunciation of open clash for covert signaling earns the shift. Embodied details (breath fogging, cloak whispering) anchor emotion to action. Secondary characters function as a pressure chorus rather than full foils, appropriate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and character‑particular, and her composure under pressure informs specific tactics (timing the hum, using the lantern as an investigative tool). The internal contradiction—bound to legacy yet seeking to break it—registers, though it’s sometimes stated rather than dramatized. Her final act reads earned, but the emotional price is more implied than felt. Occasional abstract phrasing (“controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”) blunts the rawness of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt-driven, craftsmanly care and Lena’s long-held anger create a tense, credible crucible. Micro-choices—inviting her to sit, resuming the repair as he confesses—align action with motive. The softening turn (“second opinion”) is earned by on-page pressure rather than summary. A slight didactic tilt (“proving we deserve forgiveness through change”) trims the edge of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s curiosity and irreverence are vivid and consistent, and his motives (decode, then ring the unheard bell) align with his actions. Interiority is concrete in object reactions (arrow tip, kaleidoscope) but internal contradiction is minimal—he rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price. Micro‑choices (affixing the tip, trusting the algorithm, striking the gong) track, yet they come without strong hesitation or competing impulses. The final endurance/risk (waking leviathans) hints at cost but remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s drive is coherent and active—her fixation on erasure and the Elysium case compels the lie and the risky dive. Interiority is present through perception and motive, though embodied stress under peak pressure could be sharper. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. subversion; curiosity vs. fear of corporate review) are implied but rarely dramatized simultaneously. The final endurance—accepting a partial, fragile proof—reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—turning empathy into actionable plans—is clear, embodied by the choice to reconstitute the orb rather than wait for the Council. Interiority is specific (child hunger, elder fatigue, warrior fear) and channeled into micro‑choices with the mirrors. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers, so the struggle reads more as endurance under pressure than conflicted impulse. The closing stance (act regardless of verdict) feels earned though the on‑page cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—seeking the “sound of approaching endings”—is clear and escalates from euthanasia intent to acceptance via volunteering. Embodied details (parasol tip probing ice, retrieving a child’s toy) reveal character under pressure. The contradiction between her former desire to die and present-purpose endurance is credible and earned. A touch of abstract phrasing blurs edges of peak feelings but doesn’t undercut the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s gentle, rooted need to connect and Mira’s guarded weariness drive credible micro-choices (inviting shelter, revealing the letter, accepting the shared vigil). Interiority is mostly implied through action and image rather than spelled out, which keeps them human. The internal conflict is present but soft—Mira’s hesitation dissipates quickly and their epiphanies edge tidy. Still, the final acceptance of parting carries a felt cost consistent with their motives.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear, specific motivation (“to preserve the echo of wisdom”) and a practiced method give Elar shape, but internal conflict is minimal and he faces little resistance. “Strangely honest” yields one declarative line with no visible cost. Micro‑choices exist (leaving the pavilion, entering the clearing, kneeling to consecrate) but they don’t expose contradiction under pressure. The ending reflects endurance more than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her methods (inviting villagers, curating arcs) reveal character. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; her calm competence meets minimal resistance. Emotional cost appears mostly in others (Mr. Harlan, Lila), keeping Elara’s own conflict muted. The final endurance/renunciation is gentle rather than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—decode living growth in a frozen‑language world—is clear and consistent with his reticence. Interiority is specific to a scholar’s sensibility, but internal contradiction is mild; fear of heresy is implied rather than dramatized. His final stance (quiet demonstrations vs proclamations) fits his character yet carries limited on‑page cost. The piece earns a gentle endurance/renunciation rather than a charged break.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: Elias seeks to “capture the sound of growing older” before his visions fade. Actions and tactics (chalk mapping, driftwood markers) align with that need and reveal a ritualistic, resourceful temperament. Internal contradiction is subtler—yearning versus inevitable forgetting—so pressure doesn’t fully fracture him into competing impulses. Still, the embodied ache and brief vision of his older self give the interiority credible texture.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and particular—his grief and craft cohere into the goal of “harnessing the ephemeral.” Interiority is embodied through the oak, the spinning hand, and the “luminous ache,” not just labels. His choice to restructure the clock at the leaf’s fall is motivated by prior traits (sage repairer, photographer) and grief. Slight softness in contradictory impulse under peak pressure (he rarely doubts or errs) keeps it short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s decisively kind motive drives concrete choices (bringing the shard, initiating the call), while Elias’s frailty and regret texture his participation. Interiority leans lyric rather than granular, but embodied details (tears, trembling hands) ground emotion. The relationship under pressure turns on the page when Elara cedes voice for father–daughter dialogue. The cost—Elias facing death and owning regret—is felt and earned without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained, and her “quietly deliberate” temperament shows in methodical choices. Interiority remains somewhat cool and rarely conflicted; she encounters little friction or error on the page. The final personal price—confronting her own shadow—is compelling but arrives late as declaration rather than dramatized tension. Competent, steady characterization with limited contradiction or embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “forgiving skeptic” contradiction drives credible choices: she doubts the hoax yet forgives, and still risks the maze to seek proof. Interiority is specific (bone‑setting as a moral practice) and embodied through handling the pouch, tooth, and bone. The final renunciation—choosing integration over vengeance—feels earned by prior traits. Slight softness: the vision grants answers quickly, reducing visible struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—atoning by offering light without fire—is clear and embodied through tangible choices (selecting sea glass, polishing, weighing, releasing). Internal conflict surfaces credibly at the weighing scene, where zeal meets remorse. The change is earned, though the resolution skews tidy with little lasting friction. Interiority is specific and character‑shaped, not therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—to “graft new meaning onto old wounds”—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (studying drips, arranging, then offering the pendant). The final proffer reads as an earned renunciation with felt cost. Internal contradiction (need for solitude vs. urge to share) is present, though lightly drawn. The dyadic moment with the young man functions as a crucible without lapsing into therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation and conflict are clear—he harvests hopes to fuel creation while fearing theft—and his final act (crushing the shell) credibly costs him his anchor. Interiority trends lyrical and abstract rather than embodied in micro-choices, so the contradiction is more told than dramatized. Still, his cameo choices under pressure show values in action. A touch more sensory interior struggle at peak beats would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—restore the sacred practices to heal the arbor—and actions align (choosing song over gadgets, wrapping the tendril, humming, then singing). Interiority has texture (whimsy under pressure, nerves eased by a chuckle), but contradictory impulses never sharpen into a hard trade-off. Competence remains high and largely untested; he succeeds without moral or emotional friction. The ending lacks a visible cost that would deepen character change beyond satisfaction and relief.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is vivid and particular—“to translate heartbeats into maps” toward a lost love—and her actions align cleanly with that drive. Interiority is embodied (sitting through cold, tears freezing), but contradictory impulses are minimal; she faces little internal push-pull beyond endurance. The ritual unfolds without meaningful doubt, error, or adjustment that might expose deeper flaws. The final renunciation/price is primarily endurance and ache rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and distinctive—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—and it coheres with his craft and choices. Agency is steady (study, rebuild, test), but internal contradiction is minimal, so pressure rarely exposes competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present in seasonal fatigue and frost, though largely filtered through methodical attention rather than felt conflict. The final endurance/renunciation cost is modest but credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she collects burdens to counterweight her recursion—and her ritual choices align with that drive. However, interior contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays an embodied emotional price beyond a brief risk of weaving herself. The traveler offers a momentary relational crucible, but it’s mainly instrumental. The final choice reads earned yet not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—shaping grief into something held—is consistent and enacted through micro‑choices (each cut, the pause for the kettle). Her contradictions read credibly: seeking peace while carving a predator’s strike and weary eyes. A slight neatness creeps in with labeled takeaways (“First lesson”), but the cost of enduring, not erasing, him is felt. The half‑formed lion and her decision to stop and sip registers an earned stasis rather than a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation to confront her ghost is clear and sustained, with embodied actions (wading, tuning the wheel) under pressure. Internal contradiction—ambition vs. eroded self—registers credibly without therapy-speak. The negotiation scene shows micro-choices and a values hierarchy, though the cost lands more as acceptance than sacrifice. Emotional beats are strong but slightly tidy at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—curious, competent, and bent on “equations for hope”—and her choices drive every beat. However, she faces little inner friction or contradictory impulse; the stoic steadiness flattens the arc. Her embodied reactions (cold, steady hands, tactile work) are present but spare. The final stance feels earned, though the visible personal cost is light.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to make peace with the abandoned dream) is embodied by specific actions—pilgrimage, kneeling, touching the crystal—and felt in trembling hands and tears. The internal contradiction (orderly clock scribe vs. unruly composer’s yearning) is present in scene, not just told. The endurance choice reads earned, with visible cost in “bearing the full measure of his regret.” Slight tidiness in the resolution keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive is precise and embodied—his salvage choice and final renunciation arise from a long history of being duped. Interiority is specific (the sundial, the failed marriage, fraudulent mentors) and actions align with his goal. The cost—redefining his pursuit away from “chasing legends”—reads as an earned shift. Some thematic self‑explanation edges toward over‑tidy clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (preserving ancient cultivation methods) is clear and consistently embodied in his choices to endure cold and decode the rope. Interiority is specific (the fulgurite lens, the rope’s “runes”), though internal contradiction is minimal; he stays serenely patient rather than torn. The cost—time, cold, and relinquishing the fulgurite—registers, but the emotional struggle is understated. Strong, if a touch one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motive (to eulogize the living and understand healing) drives a concrete ritual choice. Interiority is vivid and embodied (thread’s pulse, garden’s hush), with a credible price—accepting solitude. Contradiction (yearning for Mira vs. renunciation) is present but softly rendered, keeping pressure modest. No false epiphany, but the internal struggle could tighten under sharper on‑page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elandor’s desire to reawaken beauty is clear and embodied through his hands-on assembly and his trembling, biased perceptions. The internal contradiction—revival versus purity—remains present as he registers the runes’ warning yet proceeds. Micro-choices (heat source, breath rhythm, activation despite potential warping) reveal his values under pressure. A slight issue is the reliance on repeated hypothesizing over dramatized dilemma, which softens the bite of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting inherited harm into healing—is clear and embodied in the grafting ritual and nightly tending. Interiority is concrete (coin as scar, red thread as blood tie), though internal contradiction remains mild; she’s serene and assured rather than meaningfully torn. Micro-choices (mixing black sand, choosing lagoon brine, binding with the coin) reveal values under gentle pressure. The closing stance feels earned, if low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s skeptic/radiant contradiction is vivid and motivating, and her micro-choices (testing a shard, using body heat, patient vigil) align with her “realistically imaginative” stance. Embodied moments—trembling hands, brightening glow—ground emotion. The internal conflict stays tidy; doubt flickers but rarely endangers her plan, keeping struggle low-friction. The final softening of skepticism feels earned but carries modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s core motive—“share light without using fire”—is clear and consistent, and her haunted legacy supplies credible internal tension. Her choices (sonar over force, soft radiance over conflagration) align with that motive. The interiority is mostly conceptual and lyric, with limited embodied struggle, so the felt cost of restraint stays subtle. Still, the refusal of her lineage’s fire reads as an earned stance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—finding the shape of collective grief—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (unspooling the ribbon, walking its path, carving abstract swirls). His “fiercely meditative” temperament coheres with the deliberate ritual, though contradictory impulses under strain are only lightly dramatized. The mentor relationship adds pressure without eclipsing Elias’s agency. The change from inscription to weaving/carving patterns reads as an earned renunciation, if softly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s ethical diligence and guilt are concrete and drive clear micro-choices—the secret carving and the charged act of pressing the handle to the bob. Interiority is specific to his craft and conscience, not generic. The internal conflict is present but mostly aligned (duty and guilt point the same direction), so pressure feels strong rather than contradictory. The final act reads earned with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s blithe steadiness and gentle curiosity motivate every act, from prying open the case to decoding and returning it. Interiority is specific (callused fingers, hummed tune) but his conflict remains soft—ache rather than fracture. The final choice to place the case on the grave reads earned, if low-cost. A sharper tug-of-war (fear vs. duty, skepticism vs. wonder) would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, with embodied moments (the cold biting, the heart quickening) and professional detail shaping her choices. Internal contradiction is light—there’s pressure and risk but little genuine doubt or self‑conflict—so the final poised decision carries moderate, not piercing, cost. Micro‑choices (pause at the window, review models, reach for the quill) align with her goal. The “one errant line could doom the forecast” adds tension but doesn’t force a visible trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear and particular—reviving silenced narratives through clandestine broadcasts—but interior conflict is minimal and largely untested on the page. Elias’s competence faces little friction; risk is stated, not dramatized. His micro-choices (unearthed radio, choosing cloaked lyrics) align with motive but don’t exact a felt cost. The final rest signals earned stasis more than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—to crystallize fleeting emotion while knowing he will destroy it—drives concrete acts (masking, powdering, scattering). Interiority is particular and embodied (bones protesting, cracks felt), with a credible contradiction between peddling safety and exposing impermanence. The final renunciation (scattering the “final masterpiece”) lands with visible cost. A touch of thematic labeling (“weaving truth carefully”) repeats rather than deepens late.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and coherent—he seeks empirical anchors to preserve ancient methods—and his abrasive calm holds under doubt. Interiority is particular (the cog triggers a real reconsideration), and micro‑choices (continuing the dig, rejecting both narratives) reveal values. The ending stance shift feels earned with a modest felt cost (isolation from both camps), though the emotional price could be sharper on the page. Strong single‑POV character work without safety hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are consistent and specific, and her methodical “subtracting noise” tactic reveals her values under pressure. The “expectantly resigned” note creates a credible internal tension with her persistence. However, the piece softens embodied conflict—she rarely falters or pays a visible personal price beyond stamina and patience. Secondary characters apply diffuse pressure rather than sharp relational crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation and embodied craft (the shears, the tasting) make Elias vivid. His informally wise voice lands in the pruning proverb and culinary instincts guiding cuts. Internal conflict is light; he faces little resistance, so struggle feels smoothed over. The emotional cost appears when he reframes the loss of his family, but it arrives late and without much on‑page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal is clear and her agency drives the climb, riddle, and activation of the box; Thorne’s constraint (truthfulness) motivates his help. Interiority is serviceable but light—Elara largely proceeds without visible inner contradiction or cost. The moment she decodes “thunder sleeps” shows competent, not conflicted, cognition. Stakes are external and the emotional reweighting at the end is modestly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to understand why houses feel alive—is clear and consistently drives each micro‑choice (collecting, arranging, sanctifying). Interiority is specific to his perceptual bias, but there’s little contradictory impulse under pressure, so the arc feels relatively frictionless. The unlocked door beat hints at moral ambiguity but isn’t pressed for cost. The final shift reads earned if quiet, with minimal visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior conflict—rigid certainty versus a yearning for nuance—registers in embodied choices (hesitation, then threading the ampoule) and in the pain of revisiting her father. Some epiphanies arrive via telepathic “download,” which risks tidiness, but the emotional cost is shown (tears, gasped bubbles). Liriel’s pressure is consistent and character‑specific. The final shift toward forgiveness reads earned if swift.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—revisiting the “texture of a missed opportunity” to crack the staircase—drives concrete choices (dice-guided theorem, extending the proof). Interiority is specific and character‑rooted (mathematician’s lens, chipped die as flaw). A credible endurance-to-action shift culminates in stepping through the door. Contradictory impulses (grim optimism vs suspicion of illusion) surface at the end without neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—methodical hope tethered to insomnia and a quiet mission. Interiority is textured through tactile choices (moonwater, brush, scroll) rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction is mild (fatigue vs. resolve) and could press harder under strain. The final resolve to distribute anonymously reads earned but low on visible cost beyond weariness.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve dying arts and save the community by thawing the spring—is clear and embodied in concrete choices (reviving the bread‑initial custom, organizing ovens and pipes). Interiority shows credible tension between dread and resolve, with embodied detail (trembling in the rosewater chill). Costs are hinted (scarce fuel, risk of failure) but not deeply dramatized. The single‑POV focus keeps her actions aligned with her values without much contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, urgent motivation (undo the family’s loss) drives concrete choices—descent at low tide, prying the yoyo free, meticulous reverse‑engineering, initiating the mechanism. Interiority is specific (“bleak exhilaration”) and embodied in craft and environment. Contradictory impulses surface late (hope versus suspicion of illusion) but could be seeded earlier and with a sharper cost. Still, actions align tightly with motive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and urgent (post‑resuscitation return to confront abandonment fear), with credible contradictory impulses (repulsed yet allured by the setting and advisor). Interiority is concrete—aching chest, nausea at the cursed photo—though a few declarative lines (“fear incarnate”) tilt toward telling. Micro‑choices (reading paradoxes, taking the photo despite dread, continuing to confess) align with motive. The change feels earned, though the ease of triumph skirts deeper ambivalence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crisp and embodied—he refuses to flee and chooses composition—but interior contradiction is minimal and the prophet’s competence rarely strains. Embodied details (sea‑glass eyes, kelp beard, carving under pressure) reveal him, yet we get little degradation under stress. Micro‑choices (repurposing debris; timing strikes to cloud cues) are clear. The ending earns a quiet endurance rather than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is precise and sustained, and the taboo-breaking crack embodies a credible cost. Interiority is present (“trembling hands,” sacred violation) but remains more summarized than pressure-damaged, with limited contradictory impulses on the page. The choice to break a sacred shell is well motivated by months of work and the city’s dread. The ending stance—choosing to face mind-shattering watchers—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive and trait set (“emotionally rational”) govern choices—waiting for the petal, careful entry, prying the chest, and choosing a non-confrontational strategy. Anger and empathy coexist credibly, though the piece often labels these states rather than dramatizing them. The internal shift toward an empathetic exposure plan is earned but carries limited felt cost. Absence of another on‑page character limits crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to salvage and embed “abandoned dreams”—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (wading in, writing notes, placing the locket). The lineage link via the inkwell deepens his drive without contrivance. Internal contradiction is present but mild (stoic restraint vs. acute feeling), so pressure rarely forces a painful trade‑off beyond secrecy and cold. Still, actions consistently reveal character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (“to trace honest origins”) is clear and her methodical, calm temperament reliably drives her choices. Interiority is concrete—tools, tactile memory, and the stamp reflect how her mind works. However, contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely falters or pays a visible personal price beyond a reframed self‑image. The shift from indexer to guardian lands, but the emotional cost is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is precise and propulsive—he wants to fold grief into cranes—and his choices (building the lantern, making the pilgrimage, performing the ritual) align. Interiority is embodied through sensory-laden craft and the paradox of hope vs. despair. The internal conflict is credible and culminates in an earned, fragile peace. Slight limitation: almost no counter-pressure from other agents keeps the emotional crucible narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Amir’s motive is clean and particular—grief fused with scientific obsession—and his micro-choices (initiating perturbations, pressing through the wind, choosing renewal over vengeance) align under pressure. Interiority is textured with embodied cues (trembling fingers, the geode in his palm) rather than label-only feeling. The contradiction between vengeance and renewal surfaces credibly at the end. Some abstractions (“intangibly tangible”) edge toward concept over body, trimming peak intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent, and her competence reads believably, but contradiction and visible cost are minimal. The “perpetually surprised” trait remains surface-level and rarely pressures a choice. The pilgrim functions as a catalyst more than an oppositional force. The ending shift feels earned but emotionally easy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation and inner conflict are clear: he loves his sister, lied to protect her, and seeks a ritual to carry the truth. The driftwood sifting and reaction to the watch hand reveal character under pressure. Some moments lean on abstract telling (“tempered regret,” “shields”) rather than embodied contradiction, which slightly blunts immediacy. The final renunciation—no more illusions for himself—feels earned with a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt-driven motive is clear and threads every choice, from lunar timing to careful phrasing and the drawer-pull ritual. Interiority is specific (letters of apology, the talisman’s history), though the internal conflict faces little on-page pushback. The micro-choices read consistent and character-particular. The “first stir of absolution” is earned but comparatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradiction—sea-honed competence versus relational failure—is clear and embodied in the kayak vs. road choice. The hum/shanty undercuts despair without denying it, and the pocketing of the compass reads as a credible renunciation with some cost. Emotional progression is coherent if a touch tidy for the timeframe. A deeper on‑page confrontation (even a near‑step toward the kayak) would have sharpened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    Alex’s motivation—to rebuild empathy after a memory wipe—is clear and credibly pressurized by his con‑artist past. Contradictory impulses (“Why bother?” vs. choosing the tunnel, veering right, and finally releasing the ball) surface in action. Some interiority leans told (“motivationally barren”), but the closing act of tossing the baseball embodies change. The emotional turn toward regret at the lake reads earned, if slightly stated-on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (reforge the bond with Thorne) is clear and intensifies under pressure, with credible reluctance about losing her human self. Micro‑choices—harvesting spices, lighting the circle, continuing the chant as feathers erupt—track her value hierarchy. The cost (accepting hybrid form) is earned and felt. Interiority stays character‑specific through sensory filters rather than label‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—atoning for squandered time after Mira’s birth—is clear and specific, and her actions (hand‑tracing, surrender via the saucer) align with it under pressure. Embodied emotion lands (“thorns drawing beads of blood,” tears in the silver pool) and her contradiction—seeking answers in ink vs. choosing familial ritual—plays on the page. The final vow and imagined tracing of Mira’s hand registers a credible change with felt cost. Slight tidiness in the speed of forgiveness keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s pacifism, merged consciousness, and shadow work create a coherent, motivated interior with credible contradictions (urge to mend vs. suppressed rage). Her micro-choices (refusal to strike, choosing to stitch) align with traits and reveal hierarchy of values. Embodiment via buoyancy/haptics with relics is strong, though the integration of her rage and loneliness resolves a touch smoothly for maximal cost. Still, the final renunciation feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent—he gives even when broke, detours to help, and relinquishes his last resource. Interiority is present though somewhat summary-driven; contradictory impulses (skepticism of prophecy vs. action that fulfills it) are lightly sketched rather than dramatized. The rescue and release choices align with his values and show cost. Mira functions to apply immediate pressure without diluting his POV.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motive (redistribute hoarded power) is clear and her “calmly inventive” trait drives tactics with the sundial and quill. However, interior contradiction is thin—she feels little fear or guilt when the loyal sentinel passes, so pressure reveals little new about her. Micro‑choices exist (scratching guides, concealment timing) but carry limited cost. The ending asserts a coming change without dramatizing a value trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s drive (the mother’s charge vs. her self-preserving elusiveness) is clear and tested in scene, with micro-choices (placing each rock despite the vision’s cost) revealing hierarchy of values. The curse functions as a live constraint, not just label, producing believable ambivalence. The final renunciation of elusiveness reads earned by prior pressure. A touch of tell-y abstraction intrudes at times, but not enough to blunt the emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motivation (to map/counter the wounds of censorship) and a live contradiction (furious interior vs tranquil exterior) give Elias specificity. Micro‑choices—opening the envelope, resetting the vigil via the timer, choosing to “rarefy” rather than vent—track cleanly. The cost is somewhat abstract (risk and renunciation of raw rage), not bodily or socially cashed on the page, slightly muting impact. Still, his final act of clandestine dissemination reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to trade the artifact for maps that make inquiry literal—is clear and his tactically courteous temperament shows in micro-choices (halting the contact, insisting on decoding first). Interiority is gestured through “dignified chaos,” mechanical adjustments, and attention to the sundial, though the contradiction remains more labeled than dramatized. Status dynamics play cleanly against the contact and rival; his restraint versus readiness carries through. The final trade-off (losing the card to gain the maps) aligns action with motive and lands with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and rooted—this molt births a rebel intent on “forging beauty from anarchy”—and actions align (scattering seeds, arranging an altar). Interiority is textured with embodied details (callused hands, chill, glinting lid) and the legacy from Jax grounds his stance. However, contradictory impulses are muted; he transitions smoothly into certainty with little on‑page friction or cost. The final stance feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—Elias seeks to outmaneuver fate for an encore with Lila—and his choices align with that aim. Interiority is mostly conveyed through purposeful action and image rather than deep contradiction; he’s competent and rarely conflicted. The return choice (accepting the reel can’t hold) provides credible Earned Stasis with a felt cost. A touch more embodied struggle or a sharper internal contradiction under pressure would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation (safeguard cultural memory before the monsoon) is specific and consistently drives her choices—planting, entering trance, interpreting, and testing with lenses. The internal contradiction—empirical rigor versus enchanted faith—operates in-scene, not as summary. Embodied beats (pollen haze, calibrated lenses, recitation in the dream) reveal a character‑particular mind under pressure. The cost is chiefly conceptual (bearing doubt and responsibility), which lands, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive is clear and character‑particular (a slow, precise bonsai tutor seeking to process regret) and his micro‑choices (placing the compass, decoding lace, speaking the apology, pruning) align with that identity. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts and sea‑suffused perception. However, contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page; the struggle feels largely managed rather than contested. The change reads earned but relatively low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's shift from clinical detachment to humble acceptance is well-motivated and internally consistent. However, the final beats of her arc rely on summarizing her emotional state ("finding peace") rather than fully embodying it through embodied perception, slightly flattening the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes defaults to over-articulated thematic statements rather than embodied emotion. The final realization, "a legacy not of smuggling's darkness, but of transforming hardship into art," feels more like a neat summary than a messy, earned epiphany. This diagnostic self-awareness slightly flattens the character's internal struggle at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking her past trauma as a capsize survivor to the story's climax. The action of channeling her grief is a strong character beat that grounds the fantastical resolution. However, the attribute "silently expressive" is asserted more than it is demonstrated, functioning as a recurring label rather than a trait that meaningfully constrains or enables her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character's motivation feels externally imposed rather than internally generated. The shift from ignoring the spirits to determinedly helping them hinges on the package's arrival, but the "why" is asserted ("ignited something in him") rather than dramatized. The key trait "inadvertently stubborn" is repeated three times as a label, which feels mechanical and weakens the character's voice and authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions align perfectly with his "gently persistent" nature. However, his internal conflict feels more asserted than dramatized; the decision to reveal himself arrives without a visible struggle or moment of contradictory impulse. While his character is well-defined, the lack of a palpable internal crucible before his decisive action keeps it from the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, but her internal conflict lacks sharp, contradictory impulses in the present scene. The journey from wound to healing follows a linear, almost frictionless path, with the climactic realization feeling more like a discovery than a hard-won choice forged from struggle. The epiphany, while thematically coherent, is somewhat unearned, particularly the line, "The method came to her intuitively," which bypasses a more compelling process of trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-integrated, driving the entire narrative. His specific profession as a maze designer provides the unique toolkit for the resolution, making his character feel indispensable. However, the emotional embodiment relies too heavily on repeated words like "quaking" and "trembling," which slightly flattens the interiority during moments of high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with the "patiently strategic" trait. However, Elias feels more like a noble archetype than a specific, flawed individual. His interiority is often described with authorial, abstract labels like "staggering grace of intellect" rather than shown through embodied, contradictory emotions, which keeps the reader at a distance from his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, acting as the story's spine. Elias's interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail, avoiding abstraction. The final change—a release through confrontation rather than a simple healing—is earned by the preceding ritualistic actions, and the cost is felt in his tears, making the resolution powerful and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but abstract ("to eavesdrop on the fates"), and her core competence ("quietly savvy") is demonstrated well with the floral cipher. However, the climactic change of heart from master thief to destined creator is very rapid, feeling more like a discovery than an earned internal struggle. The shift is catalyzed by a magical object, which slightly lessens the weight of her personal agency in the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation and internal conflict are clear and consistent. The choice to embed the bookmark provides a solid moment of character action with cost. However, the character's interiority occasionally resorts to self-diagnosis, as in "a metaphor for his own iced-over heart," which states the internal state rather than embodying it, slightly flattening the complexity of his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character’s core contradiction—a stuntman crippled by phobias—is compelling, and his motivation is clear. However, the interiority relies on summary and diagnostic labels ("The betrayal had been transformative," "whispering affirmations that turned weakness to insight") instead of embodied experience. The transformation feels more declared than dramatized, particularly in peak moments where self-awareness is too articulate for a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The oracle's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. However, the character serves more as a vessel for the story's potent central concept than as a complex individual. The "mild obsession" is stated but lacks the friction of a true flaw; there is no moment of internal conflict or contradictory impulse, which limits the characterization's depth despite its thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eko’s motivation is clear and consistent, providing a strong spine for this short piece. However, the core character trait—being "remarkably composed"—is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized under pressure. There is no moment where this composure is genuinely threatened, which would have revealed a deeper internal conflict or a hierarchy of values with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority often relies on diagnostic labels ("a soul trapped by self-deception") rather than embodied emotion. The final emotional change feels earned by the plot, yet its description is overly articulated and tidy. This abstract self-awareness slightly undermines the character's struggle, making the resolution feel more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving his every action. His core internal contradiction—pragmatic methods in service of a deeply personal, almost spiritual belief—is well-established. However, the antagonist Thorne is a one-dimensional foil, and Elias's emotional state is often summarized ("driven by a quiet fire") rather than embodied in the moment, keeping the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    The characters are functional and their motivations are clear, establishing a warm and competent dynamic. Jax's "obliging" nature and Elara's intellectual drive are consistent. However, their interiority lacks deep contradiction; Elara's shift from scientific curiosity to fear is sudden rather than a layered struggle, and Jax's characterization leans on the label "obliging" without a moment that tests its limits.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on poetic abstraction rather than concrete, contradictory impulses. The character serves as an effective vessel for the story's atmosphere, but his internal arc feels asserted rather than earned. The final transformation from "inspired" to "transformed" is stated in the last sentence, lacking the on-page struggle that would give it deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, driving the short narrative effectively. Her interiority is present, but occasionally relies on abstract labels ("auroral sorrow," "swaying certainties") rather than fully embodied emotion. Thorne functions more as a thematic device than a fully realized character; his defining trait, "fault-tolerant," is asserted rather than demonstrated in a way that alters his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between skepticism and dawning belief is central to the arc. The state of "drowsy alertness" is an effective and specific emotional container for the events. However, the final epiphany feels more articulated than earned; the leap to understanding the specifics of his father's "deliberate escape" is a large logical jump precipitated by generic external stimuli, which undercuts the credibility of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks dynamic internal conflict. His journey reads as a smooth, preordained cycle of weariness and restoration rather than a struggle between contradictory impulses. While the earned stasis is a valid resolution, the path to it feels frictionless, limiting the character's depth beyond his archetypal role.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and poignant, effectively grounded in her backstory with Lila. However, her characterization is slightly weakened by the narrator's reliance on prompt-like labels to define her state, such as the verbatim repetition of "cautious exuberance." While her actions are consistent, this diagnostic language keeps her interiority at a slight remove, preventing it from feeling fully embodied in the story's most crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but he remains more of a vessel for discovery than a character tested by conflict. His defining traits are stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. While his interiority is present ("heart quickened"), the story lacks a moment where contradictory impulses force a costly decision, keeping the characterization effective but not deeply challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established and rooted in his backstory, making his actions plausible within the story's frame. However, the characterization falters due to the frictionless world he inhabits; the islanders are reactive props who accept his manipulations with uniform positivity, which undercuts the psychological depth of his transformation and theirs.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives his methodology. However, his interiority remains largely conceptual; we understand his purpose but experience little of his embodied emotion or internal conflict beyond a generalized resolve. The character serves as a capable vehicle for the story's ideas but lacks the contradictory impulses or specific flaws that would elevate him into a truly memorable individual.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is clear and his central affliction, "chronologically homesick," provides a compelling internal conflict. The transformation feels earned within the story's lyric logic, culminating in a credible change of state. However, the interiority relies on high-concept labels ("conductor of unheard symphonies") that feel slightly abstract rather than fully embodied, keeping it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong engine for the narrative. Her weariness is palpable, and the internal conflict is well-defined as a struggle against her own history. However, the final resolution—"she forgave, released, conquered"—is delivered as a summary, a diagnostic label that reports the change rather than embodying it in a final, contradictory micro-choice or sensation, which slightly undermines the earned nature of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his arc is coherent, but the interiority relies on some diagnostic label-speak. Phrases like "emotional numbness" and "defeating the emotional void" state the internal conflict rather than fully embodying it through his specific, moment-to-moment perceptions. The change is earned, but the articulation of that change lacks the subtlety of the story's premise.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, creating a compelling internal conflict between his curiosity and his vow of solitude. The final choice is well-earned. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into self-conscious, diagnostic language, slightly undermining the otherwise strong embodiment, as when his method is described as "progressing laterally" rather than purely shown in action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-realized, culminating in a strong moment of choice. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly too tidy and articulated, particularly the line "Tears welled as he understood—," which reads more like a diagnostic summary than a raw, in-the-moment epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear motivation that drives the entire scene. The "ethically playful" trait is successfully dramatized through both backstory and the climactic choice, making his final act feel earned and inevitable. The internal conflict is legible and resolved with a cost. The score is held just shy of the 9-band by a few instances of label-like emotional descriptors, such as "subtle passion," which tell rather than embody the feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative arc from discovery to resolution. However, the characterization itself is somewhat thin, serving more as a vessel for the theme than a complex individual with internal contradictions. The interiority, while present, occasionally leans on summary ("His motivation had always been...") rather than fully embodied perception, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes reads as overly diagnostic ("fond of the clever deceptions yet distant from their necessity"), summarizing her state rather than embodying the contradictory impulses of a being in profound transition.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Character motivation is clear but relies heavily on direct statement ("his motivation to uplift silent contributors") and backstory summary. The internal conflict is resolved too quickly to feel substantial. Key traits like "cautious exuberance" and "whimsically attentive" are applied as labels to both characters, which flattens their individuality and reads as a stylistic tic rather than earned characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirah's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong narrative engine. However, her interiority relies heavily on repeating the label "luminescent ache" rather than embodying emotion through specific, contradictory actions in a scene. Her defining trait, "boldly sympathetic," is demonstrated in summary ("paused to comfort a searcher") rather than through a difficult, costly choice, which keeps her characterization evocative but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her characterization lacks significant internal conflict. While her quest is driven by a desire to preserve her world, her interiority reads as a straightforward execution of competence. The story tells us her "true quest burned deeper," but we don't feel the contradictory impulses or the specific personal cost of this burden beyond the external risks.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, driving the entire scene. The internal conflict between grief and the intellectual desire for a solvable pattern is compelling. However, the interiority occasionally leans on thematic labels like "to understand the mathematics of emotion," which feels slightly too self-aware and less embodied than the story's strongest moments.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative from start to finish. However, the interiority occasionally slips into telling rather than showing, as with "His motivation burned steadily." The character's core contradiction—seclusion versus the desire to connect—is well-established but resolves without a deeply dramatized moment of internal struggle, making the final choice feel more like a foregone conclusion than a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between scientific curiosity and personal fear is well-dramatized ("Panic rose, but so did curiosity"). The contradiction is embodied effectively. The characterization is slightly weakened by the explicit labeling of her "circuitously sincere" nature, which feels more explained than consistently shown, though the final spoken line is a strong payoff for the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from his initial restlessness to the final exchange. His internal conflict between isolated artistic processing and communal healing resolves with a credible choice. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by the repetitive use of descriptive labels like "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe," which feel more told than shown, bordering on diagnostic label-speak that abstracts his state rather than fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority trends toward abstract summary rather than embodied experience. The climactic change feels passive; her motivation simply "aligns" with the forces, which removes the potential for a compelling internal conflict or a choice with trade-offs. The story states she has a new awareness, but we don't feel the struggle of her old self giving way to the new one.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. Her plan to hearten the exiles unfolds without error, setback, or a moment of self-doubt, which makes her feel more like a function of the plot than a flawed individual. The core trait of being "reactively visionary" is presented as a label for a magical insight that works perfectly on command, rather than a trait with tangible costs or limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority is conveyed through repetitive labels ("analytically artistic") rather than embodied through specific, unique actions. His core internal conflict is stated with the recurring phrase "trembling certainty" instead of being dramatized through contradictory choices. The final change feels declared ("his bad habits shatter") rather than earned through a difficult, particular struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and internal conflict between skepticism and kindness are clear and drive the narrative. The final shift to wonder is earned. However, some interiority is presented with diagnostic labels or authorial summary, such as "Her attribute of being courageously kind shone through," which creates distance rather than embodying the trait in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's engine. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("boredom," "desperation," "motivation") rather than embodied experience. The final change is stated ("boredom tempered by knowledge") rather than dramatized, which feels more like a summary of character development than the thing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is clear but overly articulated, bordering on a thematic label ("to find the mathematics of a fair trade"). The internal conflict between inherited deceit and chosen honesty is present, but its resolution feels too clean. The transformation at the end is asserted rather than fully dramatized, and the choice to "liquefy" their own rigid ethics is an interesting turn, though its cost is minimized by the story's final declaration that their honesty remains "intact."

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "earnestly studious" nature. The shift in his motivation at the end is earned by the scene's discovery, representing a credible character deepening. However, his interiority leans more toward the intellectual and is described with labels like "restrained fire" rather than being fully embodied, which slightly distances the reader from his emotional state at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear motivation ("discover the texture of memories") and a highly specific interiority ("filtered reality differently, seeing the world through veils of what-ifs"). The final turn, where nameless identity becomes a strength, is an earned endurance rooted in the story's events. The character's internal conflict is compellingly realized through their unique perceptual mode, making their final acceptance feel both specific and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias Thorne's motivation is clear, but his central internal conflict of "gloomy cheerfulness" is over-articulated through labels rather than embodied action. The character's shift from skeptic to believer happens too readily upon finding the seashell, softening the promised "myth buster" tension. The final emotional state feels more declared than earned through a tangible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lanara's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on labels like "orderly intuitive" and "dual allegiance" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her internal state is summarized with phrases like "hopeful desperation" instead of being embodied through specific actions or perceptions under pressure. The result is a character who serves the plot efficiently but lacks deep, particular interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and unwavering, providing a strong narrative spine. Her interiority effectively conveys a sense of loss and determination. However, her emotional state is sometimes described with diagnostic labels ("dawnlit melancholy that weighed on her soul") rather than fully embodied, which slightly flattens the character's experience in crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his competence is well-established, but he reads as an archetype rather than a complex individual. The characterization lacks internal conflict or a moment of genuine struggle; his serenity and heartfelt nature are asserted but never tested. Consequently, the resolution feels like a demonstration of a pre-existing perfect skill rather than a victory earned through overcoming a personal limit or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between confidence and anxiety is present. However, the characterization is marred by the repetitive labeling of his core traits—"dry-witted" and "subtly confident"—which are stated more often than they are seamlessly embodied. This stylistic tic flattens the interiority, making it feel more like a summary than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thorne's motivation is clear but archetypal, lacking personal stakes or internal conflict. He is more of a symbolic force than a character with contradictory impulses. His defining trait, "infinitely patient," is demonstrated through repetition but never tested by a counter-pressure, making his journey feel inevitable rather than a struggle. The characterization relies on repeated labels ("cryptic," "infinitely patient") rather than revealing depth through micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s central motivation—to "harness the ephemeral"—is conceptually intriguing but remains somewhat abstract, lacking a visceral, personal anchor. The internal conflict between panic and purpose is well-drawn, but the resolution via a "cocoon of poignant calm" feels slightly too swift and therapeutic. The character’s action to override instinct is clear, but the preceding emotional mechanics feel more asserted than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but remains abstract, articulated through thematic labels like "chasing hush" rather than embodied choices under pressure. His interiority feels overly diagnostic ("confessions of inherited doubt"), stating his internal state instead of letting it emerge from action. The final change to a state of "repose" is asserted rather than fully earned through a tangible sacrifice or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by the ancestral debt and his rekindled love. The core internal conflict, embodied in the recurring phrase "mournful elation," is well-established. However, the reliance on this specific label and others ("lovingly venomous") slightly flattens the interiority, making his emotional state feel more declared than dynamically experienced in varied ways.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth due to an absence of meaningful internal conflict. She functions more as a symbolic vessel for the theme than a person grappling with contradictory impulses. The core trait of "hauntingly optimistic" is stated but never tested against failure or doubt, making her journey feel predetermined rather than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. The character arc is legible and earned. However, the interiority occasionally slips into self-diagnosis ("rebuild the spiritual bridge she had burned," "rebuild through purposeful wandering, not aimless drifting"), which slightly abstracts her internal conflict rather than embodying it fully in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and well-embodied in her actions and tools. Her interiority is specific, particularly in the reflection on her childhood, which grounds her present rebellion. However, the characterization lacks a significant on-page internal conflict; she reads as a person of steady conviction rather than one grappling with contradictory impulses in the moment, which keeps the portrayal just shy of exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her core trait—disguising wisdom as foolishness—is well-integrated into the plot's resolution. However, her interiority feels more summarized than embodied. Moments of high pressure are described with narrative distance rather than showing contradictory impulses or visceral emotional reactions, which keeps a very strong character concept from reaching its full potential on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her internal conflict between her "cryptic facade" and the need for vulnerable confession is well-dramatized. The final change to being "ready to decide anew" is earned through the on-page ritual, but the characterization is slightly held back by the repeated label "fierce tenderness," which feels more asserted than fully embodied by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her interaction with Amir. Her interiority is present, but occasionally leans on diagnostic language ("mirroring Amir's fear of a world that might never mend"). The change at the end is earned through the scene's interaction, but the repeated label of "shrewdly innocent" feels more told than shown, slightly flattening the character's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character’s motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and sustained, providing a strong throughline. Elara’s internal state of "pensive mirth" is well-realized tonally. However, her interiority sometimes relies on direct explanation (e.g., describing her own motivation) rather than being fully embodied in contradictory impulses or subtler micro-choices, slightly softening the character's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is explicitly stated and drives the plot, but the initial declaration ("Motivated by a deep-seated desire to exchange certainty for curiosity") reads like diagnostic summary rather than a deeply embodied, contradictory impulse. While her actions are consistent with this motive, the characterization lacks the friction of internal conflict, feeling more like the fulfillment of a pre-declared thesis. The change is earned by the story's events, but its origin point feels asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias Thorne is a functional archetype whose motivation is explicitly and effectively stated. His actions align perfectly with his "charming rogue scholar" persona and defiance motive. However, the characterization lacks significant depth or internal conflict; he operates with near-perfect competence and his interiority relies on stock descriptors like a "roguish grin" and "twinkling" eyes rather than revealing contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elowen's motivation is exceptionally clear, but his characterization relies heavily on poetic labels ("insomniac poet," "shyly unstoppable") rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. His interiority is summarized with concepts like "photosynthesize pain into beauty," which reads more like a thematic thesis than a specific, embodied emotional state. While his persistence is evident, the character arc is flat; he endures until the magic works, without a significant internal shift or a difficult choice at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and poignant, effectively driving her actions. The concept of "foxglove regret" provides a specific, compelling internal state. However, the characterization relies slightly on repeating this and other labels ("gently systematic") rather than fully embodying the contradiction in fresh, unexpected micro-choices during the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. The internal contradiction of "carefully reckless" is demonstrated in her climactic action. However, Thorne's conversion from skepticism to understanding feels slightly abrupt, relying entirely on the magical vision rather than a more nuanced interaction. The repetition of the key phrase "cautious exuberance" acts as a diagnostic label, flattening the interiority it aims to describe.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization relies on telling over showing. Interior states are often summarized with labels like "dappled resolve" or "slyly heartfelt curiosity" rather than dramatized through conflicting actions. His ingenuity is asserted but never truly tested; he solves every problem with immediate insight, making him feel more like a narrative function than a person struggling with a difficult task.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between preservation and reconnection is well-drawn. The arc from crafting tales of reinvention to sending a message of raw truth is earned. However, the interiority occasionally relies on stock phrasing like "the chaos of his heart" and the emotional progression, while credible, is articulated with a slight, diagnostic neatness ("blooming hope against the withering doubt") that softens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained. The interiority is rich, but the central attribute "featherly determined" is more stated than embodied through contradictory action. The final transformation is earned within the story's introspective logic, representing a credible shift in understanding rather than a change in external circumstance, which is appropriate for the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but stated more than embodied. Phrases like "to learn the rhythm of belonging" and "sync her wandering soul" feel like diagnostic labels for her loneliness rather than a lived-in internal conflict. While her actions are consistent with this goal, the internal struggle lacks contradictory impulses in the moment; her path to connection is surprisingly linear once she finds the feather, lacking the friction of genuine self-doubt or a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. The central internal conflict of "cheerful gloom" is named and maintained throughout. However, her characterization lacks deep, contradictory impulses acting in the scene; she functions more as a perfect conduit for the story's conceptual exploration than a flawed individual whose choices have unpredictable costs. Her resolution is an intellectual epiphany that neatly soothes her emotional ache, feeling more summarized than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are perfectly consistent with his stated goal of "ordering randomness." However, his characterization lacks compelling internal conflict; he is a master orchestrator who succeeds without any apparent struggle, risk, or flaw. This competence, while central to the concept, renders him somewhat flat and predictable, missing the contradictory impulses required for a truly top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interior journey during the pivotal moment—the shift from panic to acceptance—is summarized rather than fully embodied. While her final change is earned by her actions, the internal emotional process feels slightly compressed, relying on labels like "acceptance" rather than dramatizing the complex state of becoming a living monument.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority occasionally slips into abstract, authorial language ("noctilucent reckonings," "clear complexity") rather than a fully embodied voice. The final insight is articulated with a diagnostic clarity that feels more like a thematic statement than an earned, messy epiphany. The character arc is a subtle shift in perspective, which is credible, but lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eli's motivation is clear, but his interiority is overly articulated and diagnostic, reading like a summary of his psychological state rather than an embodied experience. Phrases like "to translate pain into a universal language" and "his soul—hard softness" are authorial labels, not character-particular thoughts. Mia functions more as a thematic receptacle for his wisdom than a character applying pressure; her innocence is a stated trait, not a demonstrated worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her "logical dreamer" trait. However, her interiority lacks conflict or contradiction; she proceeds with a serene competence that is never tested. The character reads more as a flawless vector for the story's concept than a person experiencing struggle, which limits the emotional depth of her earned success.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal arc resolves too neatly. The shift from "burdened" to "lightened" happens via discovery rather than a difficult choice, and the interiority sometimes uses diagnostic labels like "sensitively perceptive cartographer felt" instead of embodying the perception. The final emotional state feels more summarized than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The painter's motivation is potent and directly tied to the central conflict and cost. His interiority is conveyed through his actions and the core concept of the "borrowed heartbeat." However, the repeated label "perceptively calm" feels asserted rather than fully embodied, slightly flattening the character's internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation for redemption is clear and drives the central action. Her defining trait, “operatively gentle,” is effectively dramatized in her humble approach to the spirits. However, her interiority occasionally relies on labels like “weary” rather than more specific, embodied emotion, keeping the characterization from feeling fully unique.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's core contradiction is compelling but delivered more through summary than through embodied action until the final choice. The motivation is clear, but the internal conflict between the "amoral philanthropist" and the "secretly sentimental heart" reads as a stated premise rather than a felt, moment-to-moment struggle. Lines like "sentiment had cracked his resolve" tell us about the change rather than dramatizing the agonizing process of that change, making the final turn feel slightly schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation to defy conformity is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, her interiority relies heavily on the repeated, stylized language of the prompt (e.g., "bodily poetic") rather than developing a more particular inner voice. The character functions well as a vessel for the story's theme, but her internal conflict feels more stated than embodied through contradictory micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation from "urbane calligrapher" to "subversive puppeteer" feels more intellectually conceived than emotionally earned in this short space. The internal conflict is present, but his epiphanies are slightly over-articulated, reading like diagnostic self-awareness ("He realized his calligraphy... had often served manipulative ends") rather than a messy, embodied discovery. The character is a strong vessel for the theme, but lacks the contradictory impulses acting in-scene that would elevate him further.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but the character reads more as an elegant vessel for the story's theme than a person with palpable internal contradictions. While the "blush of realization" provides a moment of genuine embodiment, his philosophical framework is articulated with a diagnostic clarity that feels external. His interiority is coherent but lacks the friction of competing, less noble impulses that would elevate him beyond a symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The motivation is clear and consistent, but the core emotional journey of forgiving herself is summarized as a past event, flattening the on-page arc. Interiority relies heavily on stated emotions and provided keywords like “snowmelt ardor” rather than dramatizing a struggle. Elara reads more as a competent functionary for the plot than a character with internal contradictions in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal state is more summarized than embodied. The epiphany arrives neatly in a dream, lacking the texture of a genuine, contradictory internal struggle. The repeated use of labels like "ethereal grit" and "precisely playful" to define her state reads as authorial shorthand rather than earned characterization revealed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear, but his primary trait, "frugal," feels like a recurring label rather than a quality that forces a difficult choice. The central conflict of science vs. magic is stated ("he, a man of science, now turning to enchantment") but not dramatized as a deep internal struggle; his transition to magic is seamless and without apparent cost to his scientific identity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character motivations are clear, but the execution lacks depth. Elara's "scheming" is reduced to a single, magical action rather than a demonstrated, intricate plan. Thorne is a passive recipient of a cure, making his transformation feel unearned and diminishing his agency in his own arc.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted believably in grief for his late wife. The central conflict between his "firmly grounded" nature and "uncharacteristic longing" is well-established and drives the narrative forward. While some interiority relies on labels like "longing," his decisive actions during the ritual serve as strong, embodied expressions of his character.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his feisty, grief-stricken persona is consistent. His internal conflict between willful persistence and underlying sorrow is palpable. However, the characterization is weakened at the very end when he articulates the story's theme directly ("Accidents, my dear, are wisdom's favorite disguise"), a moment of diagnostic self-awareness that feels less like an earned character beat and more like an authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and serves as the story's engine. His internal state of "brightened disquiet" is a compelling contradiction, though it is sometimes stated more than embodied. The final shift from "thrilling dread" to "resolute calm" feels slightly abrupt but is earned by the magnitude of the revelation, representing a credible change in his stance towards his duty and its inherent dangers.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization as "carefully resourceful" is well-executed, as her primary action directly demonstrates this trait rather than just labeling it. Thorne is more of a catalyst, driven by a clear but one-note desperation. Elara's internal motivation—deciphering silent harmonies—is consistent, but her interiority lacks contradictory impulses in the moment, reading more as a steady state of scholarly observation than a mind under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic labels like "blissfully aberrant" instead of dramatizing this trait through specific, contradictory choices under pressure. Her internal conflict is described more than it is actively shown. The final change feels more like a conceptual shift than a deeply embodied, earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels like "warmly methodical" rather than earned, contradictory impulses shown through action. The struggle is intellectual, a puzzle to be solved with perfect competence, which flattens her interiority. The story shows her succeeding but doesn't dramatize the internal cost of the "cacophony of what-ifs" beyond stating its existence, leaving her feeling more like a function of the plot than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong spine for the narrative. Her interiority, however, relies more on articulating her philosophy ("true peace wasn't fragile silence but a hammered repose") than on dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The final realization feels more like a summary of the theme than an earned, embodied epiphany, reading as slightly too self-aware for a character mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire plot. However, her interiority is more declared than embodied; phrases like "her motivation burned fiercely" and "her heart raced" are stock representations of emotion. The core struggle feels external and procedural, lacking a compelling internal conflict or a moment where contradictory impulses are genuinely in play before the final, somewhat unearned, blossoming into certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative, and her final shift from observer to creator is earned. However, her interiority relies on repeating the label "preemptively nostalgic" rather than fully embodying the emotion through varied, concrete perception, which slightly flattens her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The characterization is strong and consistent. Elias's motivation is the clear engine of the story, and his internal conflict is shown through his actions, particularly the chanting. However, some of the interiority relies on direct labeling, such as "mirroring the hopelessness that pulled at him like an unseen gravity," which slightly lessens the impact compared to more purely embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is very strong, particularly for Kael. His motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his role as an observer. However, his interiority occasionally slips into overly analytical self-awareness, using phrases like "he employed a tangential approach," which reads more like an author's summary of method than an organic thought, slightly undermining the otherwise immersive POV.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict is well-established, though the final transformation into "resilient openness" feels more summarized than embodied. While her actions align perfectly with her goals, the resolution lands as a slightly unearned epiphany rather than a complex, contradictory emotional state earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving his actions. Mira serves as a functional foil, though her transformation from frantic passenger to serene convert feels slightly accelerated for this length. The characters lean more towards well-executed archetypes (Wise Guide, Troubled Soul) than deeply individuated people, with Mira's backstory of "betrayals and bustling cities" remaining a generic label.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization remains functional rather than deep. The defining trait "wisely adventurous" is stated and then described in action ("calculated bravery") rather than dramatized through a choice where wisdom and adventure conflict. Her journey is one of pure competence; she lacks a flaw or internal contradiction that would complicate her choices, making the resolution feel more like a task completed than an earned personal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear but stated too explicitly, reading like a character sheet ("Her attribute was... Her motivation burned..."). The dialogue at the climax resorts to diagnostic label-speak, with both characters articulating their thematic roles ("I encroach because I suffocate..."). This flattens the emotional complexity of the moment, making the resolution feel more like a tidy therapeutic summary than an earned, messy human interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in her backstory as a pyramid scheme survivor. However, her core trait of being "virtuously mischievous" is more asserted than dramatized in the present action; the key on-page examples—a playful excuse for diving and taunting a bolt—lack the weight of the backstory example (sneaking spores). While her resolve to "translate this into diamonds" is a strong internal driver, the actual internal conflict is minimal, presenting a straight path from decision to triumph without significant self-doubt or contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on abstract labels like "bridge of intuition" rather than embodied, contradictory thought. The arc is a confirmation of a pre-existing choice, which is acceptable for this length, but the internal process feels overly rational and declarative, lacking the texture of genuine struggle or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The knight's motivation ("to capture the shape of possibility") is established but remains abstract, lacking concrete interior contradiction. His primary emotional state is repeatedly labeled "shivering bliss," which flattens the character's journey into a single, declared feeling. While his final choice aligns with his motives, the emotional progression feels more asserted than embodied, preventing the characterization from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is well-rendered. However, the climactic emotional connection feels slightly over-articulated. The line connecting her ex's note to the button ("a button of sorts, a tiny anchor") is a piece of diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undermines the embodied, contradictory feeling of a genuine epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core trait of resourcefulness is effectively demonstrated through action, particularly in using the lagoon to amplify the signal. However, her interiority remains somewhat archetypal, relying on stock phrases like "heart pounding." The characterization is competent and serves the plot, but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses under pressure that would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The saxophonist's motivation is singular and clear, driving the narrative effectively. His interiority, colored by "eerie nostalgia" and memories of a lonely past, provides sufficient depth for this length, and the micro-choice to whisper "enough" into his instrument is a well-executed moment of escalating intent. The character feels more like a mythic archetype than a complex individual, which works for the story's tone, but the absence of any meaningful internal contradiction or flaw being tested prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks meaningful internal conflict. Her journey is a straight line of "delighted determination" without doubt, struggle, or a difficult choice that reveals deeper character contradictions. The emotional state of "mossy delight" is asserted repeatedly but remains one-dimensional, missing the complexity expected for publication as she faces no genuine test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the internal state is often stated rather than embodied. Phrases like "His motivation stirred: to befriend uncertainty" and the explicit naming of the attribute "uncertainly certain" feel like diagnostic labels. The character's final choice is earned by the plot's events, but the interiority lacks the concrete, contradictory texture expected for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on recurring diagnostic labels like “luminous regret” and “kintsugi intentions.” This abstracts his emotional state rather than fully embodying it, particularly at peak moments where a more granular, contradictory experience would be more compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on elegant summary than on embodied, contradictory impulses in the scene. Thorne serves his function as a vessel for guilt and release effectively for this story's length. The line of dialogue, "The ache is luminous," is a significant flaw, feeling like an authorial intrusion that breaks from a character's natural speech to state the story's key phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her interiority is vividly rendered through the agony of her enhancement. The internal conflict between her analytical goal and the overwhelming trauma is well-dramatized. However, the final epiphany, while earned, feels slightly too articulate and intellectualized, particularly the precise calculation of her spine's angle, which borders on diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong narrative spine. However, her characterization lacks meaningful internal conflict or flaws that complicate her choices in the scene. She proceeds with unwavering competence, and the resolution feels more like a fulfillment of a pre-existing state than a genuine change earned through struggle, which limits the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking his backstory to his present actions. However, the backstory itself is delivered in a single expository sentence rather than being fully embodied. The character’s competence is slightly over-determined, as seen when he immediately understands the arcane nature of the mainspring barrel without struggle, which lessens the impact of his internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, consistent, and effectively drives the plot from start to finish. However, the interiority remains largely conceptual; emotions are described with grand, abstract phrasing rather than being specifically embodied. While the final change of perspective is earned, its emotional impact is muted by this intellectual distance, keeping the characterization shy of top-tier execution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his past as a “defunct revolutionary.” His internal state of “burnished sorrow” provides a strong emotional anchor. The final change, from defunct to rekindled, is earned by the discovery, and his choice to frame it poetically aligns perfectly with his character. However, some emotional beats, like "His heart ached with burnished sorrow," are slightly more stated than embodied, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his moment of doubt provides a flicker of internal conflict that is resolved on the page. However, the character remains a fairly standard archetype of the pure-hearted artisan. The resolution lacks a visible personal cost beyond the immediate struggle, which makes his triumph feel emotionally tidy and his character arc somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and her actions are consistent, but the final epiphany feels overly articulated. The line "she understood her eccentricity as sensibility incarnate" reads as diagnostic self-awareness, a label applied after the fact rather than an embodied, contradictory internal moment. This slip into thematic summary at the peak of her internal arc softens an otherwise solid characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear but lacks internal contradiction. Her discovery perfectly amplifies her existing goals rather than challenging them, making her arc a smooth affirmation instead of a struggle. The phrase "her motivation was to scaffold complexity" reads more like a diagnostic label than an embodied drive, slightly flattening the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her final shift from questioning to knowing is earned. However, her interiority occasionally relies on diagnostic summary rather than embodied emotion, as when her past is reduced to "healing from a love lost to illness" or her insight is labeled "a lesson in vulnerability." These moments abstract the feeling instead of letting the reader experience it through her specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the plot forward logically. However, Elias feels more like a vessel for the story's high concept than a fully fleshed-out individual. The transition from "solemn archivist" to a desperate spiritual negotiator is functionally sound but lacks a deeper layer of internal contradiction or embodied struggle beyond the stated desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent, particularly the powerful renunciation of the bottle. However, the interiority, while functional, relies on declarative statements like "His motivation surged" and "his mind burned with a deeper purpose." These moments summarize his internal state rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory, or sensory-rich perception, slightly flattening the character's lived experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is well-established and consistent, driving the central action. The final turn where he archives his own fears of obsolescence adds a necessary layer of personal vulnerability. However, his interiority sometimes relies on declarative statements ("His motivation burned steadily") rather than fully embodied experience, which slightly distances the reader from his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary internal conflict is articulated through the repetitive label "furiously tranquil" rather than being fully dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. While her hands tremble and the cold bites, the deeper emotional state is told more than it is embodied, slightly flattening the character's interiority at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear but over-articulated, functioning more as a thematic label than a deeply felt internal drive. The key moment of internal conflict—"Yet doubt flickered"—is presented as a brief, abstract summary rather than an embodied struggle, undercutting the pressure of his choice. He reads as a consistent but somewhat flat vessel for the story's theme, lacking the messy contradictions that create a truly compelling character.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on over-articulated, diagnostic labels. Phrases like "Elara's heart ached with shared fragility, her own vulnerabilities surfacing like hidden constellations" summarize emotion rather than embodying it. The final epiphany feels more stated than earned through an in-scene struggle with contradictory impulses; the conflict is presented tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative to its conclusion. However, his core traits are sometimes over-articulated through direct labels like "tranquilly perceptive nature," which slightly undermines the interiority by telling instead of purely showing. The final change to purposeful peace is earned, but the characterization relies on elegant summary more than embodied contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative forward. However, her interiority, while stylistically fitting, lacks significant contradiction; she proceeds with unwavering focus. A moment of genuine doubt or a choice between competing values would have added more depth, as her path from seeker to enlightened sharer feels a bit too linear and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from finding the feather to healing the drake. Elias is an effective vessel for the theme. However, his journey lacks significant internal friction; his competence feels pre-ordained and his method "came naturally," which lessens the impact of his struggle and makes the resolution feel slightly unearned. A moment of doubt or a flawed first attempt would have deepened the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks internal conflict. His "brazen calm" is presented as a static trait rather than a hard-won state, which flattens the emotional arc. There is no moment of doubt or contradictory impulse, making his journey feel pre-ordained and diminishing the sense of struggle against his diagnosis. His actions align perfectly with his motives, but without a visible internal crucible, he functions more as an archetypal figure than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative from her initial skepticism to her final, earned shift in perspective. The internal conflict between her rebellious intellect and her innate curiosity is well-dramatized through her actions. While the supporting characters are brief, they effectively apply pressure at the climax, particularly the archivist who catalyzes Elara's change without diminishing her agency in accepting the new evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and consistent, but he lacks interiority or internal conflict. He functions more as a mythic archetype executing a flawless ritual than a character making choices under pressure. His competence is absolute, and there is no struggle, contradiction, or visible cost to him personally, which makes the characterization feel flat and predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is sometimes clouded by overwrought, authorial prose. The character of Tracker, while emotionally resonant, functions as a convenient plot device when he unerringly leads her to the phonograph, softening the impact of her own struggle and discovery. Elara’s emotional progression from rummaging to deciphering to a surge of hope feels somewhat compressed for the weight of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict as the "blessed pariah" provides a strong foundation. The final shift from enduring isolation to embracing her gift as a tool for exploration is earned through her adherence to the family custom. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of telling rather than showing the emotional shift, such as "confusion started to morph into exploration," which summarizes the change instead of fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on assertive labels ("chivalrous thief," "sacredly playful") rather than demonstrating these traits through difficult choices with tangible trade-offs. Elarion's interiority is stated, not embodied, and he lacks any meaningful internal conflict or flaw that complicates his task. His success feels preordained, and his final confrontation is resolved by his tools, not a costly personal choice, making him read more as a function of the plot than a compelling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alex's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-grounded in his backstory. However, the core internal conflict, "benevolently ruthless," is more stated and explained than dramatized as a contradictory impulse acting in the present scene. His interiority leans towards labeling his state rather than embodying the struggle, making him feel slightly more like a conduit for the theme than a fully textured individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, driving the narrative from a state of pained avoidance to proactive confrontation. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her choice to abandon the “substitutions” for the painful truth offered by the stone. Her final change is earned, culminating in the powerful realization that “hidden thunder [is] now her ally,” perfectly encapsulating her arc from victim of her pain to wielder of its power.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict is well-defined, but its expression sometimes relies on direct labeling ("unravel the knot of self-blame," "inner storm of determination") rather than fully embodied contradiction in the moment. The final change is earned, but the transition feels slightly articulated with phrases like "forgiving the young tutor he once was," which borders on diagnostic summary in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully clear, and her arc toward accepting the cost of wisdom is well-realized. However, the interiority occasionally slips into a high-level, diagnostic register, stating thematic beliefs ("forgiveness came not from erasure, but from refraction") rather than embodying them through purely in-the-moment perception. This makes the character feel, at times, like a hyper-articulate vessel for the story's concept.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between doubt and purpose drives the narrative. The change from "uncertain alchemist" to one of "conviction" is earned through his actions. However, the interiority occasionally relies on declarative statements ("Doubt plagued him") rather than fully embodying the conflict through perception and sensation in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is well-established and his internal conflict is clear. However, the final change is articulated with diagnostic self-awareness ("his nostalgia was a chain") rather than being fully embodied in a messy, contradictory moment. The resolution feels more like a summarized epiphany than a deeply earned, character-particular transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, his interiority sometimes relies on abstract, overwritten phrases like "screaming tenderness," which state a complex emotion rather than embodying it through contradictory impulses in the moment. The resolution, while fulfilling his goal, is so neat that it slightly lessens the weight of his years-long struggle, making his earned change feel less costly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and tied to their physical form, a powerful central conceit. The final transformation to being "whole in their fragmentation" is an earned and resonant change. However, the internal conflict feels more like a steady, unwavering purpose; a moment showing contradictory impulses in-scene, rather than a summary of past loss, would have elevated it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and consistent, driving the entire narrative. However, her interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic self-awareness ("cultivate psychological safety," "rationalized it perfectly"), which feels more like an authorial summary than an in-the-moment thought process. While her truthfulness is a compelling trait, its primary on-page manifestation—confessing the ritual's success—feels slightly less costly than its introduction implies, as she is alone.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is well-established and his final choice is consistent with his eccentric nature. However, the story leans on diagnostic summary to articulate his internal change, particularly in the final third. Lines like "Decoding the gesture meant embracing the borrowed memories" state the character arc's thesis directly, weakening the earned quality of his transformation by replacing embodied experience with an intellectual conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his final transformation from being burdened by a promise to being healed by it is earned. The internal conflict between his methodical nature and the need for an intuitive leap is well-dramatized, particularly when he abandons the map. The core character trait is slightly over-stated rather than purely shown, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from disenchantment to resolve. The internal conflict between her dreams and the council's warning is established, but her interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels ("hollow victories," "turbulent world") rather than fully embodied emotion. The repetition of the trait "softly commanding" acts more as a recurring tag than a deeply integrated character aspect revealed through varied action. Lir functions effectively as a secondary character providing an anchor and a moment of human connection during the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic labels like "scientifically romantic" and "equations of emotion" instead of embodied, contradictory feelings. Her transformation feels asserted rather than earned through struggle; the "palette of resolve" is a symbolic summary of courage, not a dramatization of it. The character reads more as a vessel for the story's concepts than a person with compelling internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is sharp and consistent, rooted in a compelling internal conflict between a desire for untamed experience and the compulsive need to chronicle it. The arc from jealous paralysis to empowered acceptance is earned. However, the interiority occasionally relies on repeating key thematic phrases ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder"), which reads more like self-diagnosis than fully embodied emotion in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and poignant, stemming directly from her backstory. Her choice to share her own loss is a strong, character-defining moment that drives the emotional core of the scene. However, Mira's character feels slightly too convenient, arriving with a problem and a history that perfectly mirror Elara's quest, and her final lines articulate the theme with a neatness that slightly undermines her individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives her actions. The internal conflict between the need for ceremonial focus and her stress-induced crystallization is well-embodied and resolved through a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The final emotional state of being "unburdened" is earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is compelling and clearly established, but the execution of her character is marred by summary and direct labels. The narration explicitly states her trait as an "advisor through metaphors" instead of demonstrating it organically through choices under pressure. Her climactic line to Lila—"Our bond was like an orchard before the cut..."—reads as a self-conscious thematic statement rather than a desperate, personal appeal, slightly undermining the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The Witness is more of an archetypal functionary than a character. While his motivation is clear ("to unravel cosmic illusions"), it is never tested or complicated by internal conflict or external resistance. He reads as a flawless, omni-competent being executing a pre-ordained task, which limits any sense of struggle or earned change. The characterization lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that create depth.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the central action effectively. The interiority during the countdown is specific and revealing. However, the final moments of epiphany use abstract, summary-like language ("his motivation crystallized," "Elias understood") which somewhat flattens the earned complexity of the preceding sequence, telling the reader the change rather than fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her epiphany is earned through the plot, but Kai's mirroring of her loss ("a family scattered like spores") feels overly convenient, making their connection less a crucible and more a thematic alignment. The shift from heartache to resolution is a little too smooth, lacking the friction of genuine emotional contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-drawn, but the story relies on over-articulated, diagnostic self-awareness at the climax. The line, "She realized this mirrored her life—her father's gambling was a heart attack of unchecked risks, while her teaching was a safe rebellion, theoretical but impotent," replaces an embodied epiphany with a neat, intellectual summary, flattening the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear but borders on a thematic thesis statement rather than an embodied drive. The final turn where he applies his philosophy to himself provides a meaningful change, but the shift feels slightly abrupt. The characterization relies more on the elegance of the concept than on deep, contradictory interiority in the moment, as seen when his reaction to being discovered is a bit muted ("Elias froze").

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the story's ritualistic action. The interiority effectively captures his contradictory state of "haunted euphoria," a specific and earned emotional texture. However, the final change, while legible, relies on summarizing labels like "covenant stronger" rather than being fully embodied in a final, concrete perception, which slightly mutes the impact of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, with a clear internal conflict between his "desperately jocular" mask and his profound loneliness. The change is earned through his climactic choice to risk vulnerability, and his final state—a "softened" jocular edge—is a credible, satisfying resolution with a visible cost. The secondary characters, though brief, effectively serve their role in the collective.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and the “quiet blaze” is a superb, particular image for his grief. The internal conflict is established well with the “stormy sea” metaphor, but the final transformation into acceptance feels slightly too swift and complete. A lingering trace of the storm, or a more contradictory final emotion, would elevate an already strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but her defining trait, “confidently uncertain,” reads as a label rather than an embodied contradiction driving her choices. The internal conflict over her past mistake is resolved too neatly, without a sufficient on-page struggle that earns the final peace. Her actions are consistent, but the character arc lacks the friction of a genuine trade-off, feeling more like a summary of a change than a dramatized one.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is palpable, particularly the well-realized contradiction of “joyful sorrow.” Thorne functions effectively as a catalyst, and his motivation is stated. However, Thorne’s characterization relies heavily on the repeated label “quietly charismatic” rather than demonstrating it entirely through action, which slightly flattens his presence. Elias's final change is earned through the central action of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively, culminating in a well-earned character shift. However, the interiority relies on repeated, high-register phrases like "volcanic tenderness," which feel more like authorial labels than embodied emotions. This slightly undermines the otherwise strong character work by telling instead of showing the character's core contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her rebellious nature is shown, not told, through her defiance of protocols. The internal conflict between grief and hope is potent, particularly in the concept of "auroral sorrow." While strong, the interiority occasionally leans on high-concept abstractions ("sea of auroral sorrow," "cosmic sigh") that feel slightly more declared than embodied in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action, while Marcus serves as an effective, if simple, foil. The story successfully shows character through action, particularly Elias's methodical use of his tools. However, Elias's hyper-competence and the flawless execution of his plan leave little room for internal conflict or genuine struggle, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier; he reads more as a vessel for the theme than a person wrestling with a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final decision provides a credible change. However, the turn feels more reactive than earned; she observes a perfectly calibrated symbolic lesson and then understands it, which lacks the friction of a true internal struggle in the climactic moment. The guardian is a well-executed archetype, but his stated motivation ("to teach darkness the value of stars") reads more like a thematic label than a character-driven goal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the execution lacks palpable internal conflict. Elias operates with a serene certainty that undercuts the tension of his rebellion; his interiority is described rather than embodied. A moment of genuine doubt or fear during the vigil would have deepened the characterization beyond his resolute exterior.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation for freedom is potent and consistent, creating a compelling internal conflict against her love for Marek. Their dynamic of "combative tenderness" is exceptionally well-realized, serving as a crucible that forces their choices. Marek's character shift, catalyzed by the scrimshaw, is both magical and emotionally credible, making his final act of letting her go a powerful, earned moment of love and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s characterization is strong, with his internal contradiction (reporting vs. aiding) established efficiently. His motivation to "cultivate lightness in grief" is specific and compelling, driving the central action. The external performance of the blank face and theatrical narration contrasts powerfully with the implied inner weight, creating a complex and memorable protagonist whose earned stasis at the end feels authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear but lacks depth. Elias functions more as a thematic vessel than an individual, with an interiority composed of abstract labels like "aesthetically driven" and "tremor of certainty." The story explicitly removes internal conflict ("not doubt's shake"), resulting in a flat character arc that is a straightforward execution of intent without struggle or believable contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's final change is earned and powerful, but the initial stated motivation—"to find beauty in imperfection"—is at odds with his primary action of trying to "fix" his perceived imperfection by gaining color vision. The attribute "innocently cunning" is also more of a label than a dramatized contradiction, appearing twice as a direct tag.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative. However, her characterization relies on repeated labels like "powerfully gentle" rather than dramatizing this trait through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Her interiority is functional but uses stock phrasing ("heart raced"), preventing a deeper, more particular sense of character from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is well-established and consistent, but his interiority relies more on descriptive labels like "subdued ardor" than on showing contradictory impulses in the moment. Lira functions effectively as a catalyst for Elias's arc, though she remains more of a type than a complex character. The dialogue feels overly thematic, serving as a direct statement of purpose rather than a natural interaction, which slightly flattens the character exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Character motivations for both Elara and Marcus are clear and consistent. Elara's is driven by her inherited purpose, and Marcus's by guilt. However, Marcus's dialogue can feel more like a vehicle for thematic exposition than natural speech ("echoes of older patterns I ignored"), slightly flattening his individual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, and her central internal conflict—"anguished joy"—is brilliantly embodied in the chaotic, ecstatic dance. The final moment of acceptance is earned and powerful. The characterization leans heavily on the archetypal, serving the lyrical tone perfectly, though a touch more specificity in her interiority beyond the (admittedly effective) core label would have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to "preserve the shape of hope" is clear and consistent, driving her actions from investigation to resolution. The internal conflict culminates effectively when she realizes the shadow is her own regret, forcing a choice between erasure and integration. The final cost, a lingering "luminous regret," provides a meaningful character change, though some interiority like "her motivation burned quietly within" feels more stated than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate self-analysis. Phrases like "he shed that layer of unchecked empathy, tempering it with self-respect" read more like a diagnostic summary than an in-the-moment emotional process. The internal conflict is well-defined but lacks the messy, contradictory impulses of a character genuinely in crisis, making the progression feel slightly too linear and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative forward. However, her characterization relies on abstract labels like "closure seeker" and diagnostic summaries of her internal state, which tells the reader her psychology rather than showing it through nuanced action. The emotional embodiment during the climax is strong, but the initial setup feels more like a character sketch than a lived-in persona.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her primary trait, "spatially imaginative," is effectively linked to her psychometric method. However, the character's internal state is often described with abstract, high-register labels ("storm of revelation whispering fiercely") rather than embodied through contradictory, granular feelings, which keeps her at a slight emotional distance from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, and her emotional arc from "trembling hands" to being "utterly at rest" is well-defined. However, her interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic statements about her own condition, such as defining "remembered stardust" as "the key to unlocking her creativity." This slightly undermines the sense of genuine, in-the-moment struggle and discovery, reading more like a summary of the theme than an embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and elegantly linked to his unique ability, providing a strong foundation for his actions. The character's interiority is consistent, but occasionally leans more on conceptual description ("burdened by a mind") than embodied emotion, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier. The cost of his vigil is felt, making his endurance credible and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the transformation from "stray" to "sovereign" provides a satisfying arc. The internal conflict between rigid doctrine and rediscovered intuition is well-dramatized through his actions. However, the emotional interiority occasionally relies on summary ("His motivation surged") rather than fully embodied experience, slightly distancing the reader from the peak moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on pre-packaged thematic labels like "leash of doubt" and "unused courage." While her trembling hand versus her resolve shows some internal conflict, the characterization lacks a deeper, more particular texture that would elevate it beyond a well-executed allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic self-awareness. Lines like "the cost of safety was this enduring quiet, a barrier against chaos but a cage for the spirit" read more like an author's summary than a character's immediate realization under pressure. The final choice is earned, but the path to it relies on overly articulated thematic statements rather than purely embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her defining paradox—the "diminutive titan"—is well-conceived. However, her interiority remains somewhat abstract, conveyed through summary ("burned quietly," "sensed the climax") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. While her resolve is never in doubt, the lack of a visible internal struggle or a moment of vulnerability keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her central habit—the tapping—is well-integrated into her character arc. Her final emotional response is earned. However, her father's characterization is delivered via a slightly too-convenient expository confession, which makes his motivation feel more like a plot device than a deeply felt history.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but stated rather than consistently embodied. The core trait “awkwardly confident” is asserted three times but the “awkward” half is not demonstrated in her actions, which read as decisive and graceful. The final epiphany feels more like a convenient plot beat than an earned psychological shift, lacking the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action, from decoding the kite to the final dive. Her defiance is well-established. However, her internal conflict is minimal; she proceeds with unwavering resolve, which makes her feel more like a function of the plot's needs than a character wrestling with contradictory impulses. The lack of a moment of genuine doubt or a difficult trade-off keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, driving his actions from his botanical work to his internal struggle. The internal conflict between traumatic memory and the will to endure is palpable during the freeze. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of diagnostic self-awareness, such as naming his reaction "somatic markers," which feels more like a label than an embodied experience in that specific line.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract, philosophical phrasing. The repeated rhetorical questions function as diagnostic self-awareness rather than embodied emotion, summarizing the story's themes instead of showing a character grappling with them. For example, "isn't pain the true canvas of creation?" reads as authorial thesis, not the specific, contradictory thought of a person in crisis, which limits the character's individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elowen's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-grounded in both a past trauma and a present catalyst. The "serene anger" is a compelling and specific emotional state that drives the plot. However, the final realization is articulated with clinical, diagnostic language ("a neural surge, amplified by adrenaline...") which feels like an unearned, external summary rather than a character-particular epiphany experienced mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her core internal conflict, "bravely conflicted," is more often stated as a label than dramatized through competing micro-choices. The transition from conflict to resolve happens in an instant ("bravely conflicted no more") rather than feeling like a fully earned, embodied struggle. The line "wondering if bravery always felt this vertiginous" is a strong moment of specificity, but it stands out against the more summary-level interiority elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract labels ("tranquil blaze," "senseless perception") rather than embodied, contradictory emotions. The core conflict with her father’s legacy is presented as a settled philosophical stance, making her actions a demonstration of principle rather than a struggle. The characterization is coherent but lacks the messy, in-the-moment internal friction required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eron's motivation is clear and his defining trait, "cool-headed," is demonstrated through consistent, deliberate action. The internal conflict is present but minimal, as in the moment his "heart stirred, but he remained composed," which provides a necessary glimpse of feeling beneath the calm exterior. The final choice to release the echo provides a satisfying character resolution, though the interiority leading up to it feels more archetypal than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her shift from observation to intervention is well-earned. The internal conflict between her solitary, observant nature and the need to act is compelling. However, her core traits are sometimes stated directly ("devotedly observant," "solemn playfulness") rather than revealed purely through action, which slightly flattens the interiority in an otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, the interiority relies on high-concept labels like "dissonance of old guilt" and a "dissonant roar," which feel more declared than embodied. The final change is earned through action (tattooing herself), but the emotional progression feels somewhat compressed and overly articulated, particularly in the final moments of forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on labels ("whimsical flair," "socially perceptive") than on embodied, contradictory interiority. She functions as an almost flawless catalyst for the group's change with little internal struggle or personal cost shown on the page. The final realization feels more like a tidy thematic summary ("the beauty of connection born from chaos") than an earned, messy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation as a "gentle radical" is clear and consistent, but the characterization relies heavily on such labels rather than showing these contradictory impulses through embodied action. His internal conflict is articulated more than it is dramatized. The final choice is motivated by the climactic vision, but the character feels more like a vehicle for the story's theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but her transformation from "gnawing void of despair" to "luminous possibility" feels too swift and complete to be fully earned. Silas's motivation is serviceably clear but stated rather than shown. The emotional arc relies on magical intervention, making Elara's internal change feel more received than achieved, slightly flattening her character development at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alex's "affectionate skeptic" persona provides strong, consistent internal conflict that drives the story. His motivation to connect with Mia is clear and compelling. The character arc feels earned, but the resolution hinges on him conveniently recalling a specific psychology article mid-crisis, which feels like a slightly too-tidy intellectual solution rather than a purely embodied, desperate discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear but lacks internal conflict; she is unwavering from the start, which limits character depth. Her emotional reactions are well-embodied through the heat-mapping device, a creative way to show instead of tell. However, the story chronicles a confirmation of her existing purpose rather than a costly choice or change, making the characterization functional but not deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eland’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a desire to transform fate rather than just defy it. The brief reflection on his past self, prompted by the silver button, provides a specific, earned anchor for his philosophy. However, some moments of interiority, like "raw possibility blooming within him," lean toward telling rather than embodying emotion, slightly flattening the character's internal experience at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The motivation to "fix what was broken" is clear and consistent. However, the characters feel more like archetypes delivering thematic lines than individuals with unique interiority. Mira's echoing of the "unused courage" theme feels too convenient, and the trait "prudently daring" is stated as a label rather than fully dramatized as an internal conflict within a specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The characterization relies on telling over showing, with motivation and emotional states stated in abstract terms ("to distill complexity into essence," "spindrift serenity"). Elias remains emotionally static; he begins and ends in a state of calm, making the final unburdening feel more like an intellectual confirmation than an earned emotional shift. There is little sense of struggle or internal contradiction to give his final insight dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "zen-minded" nature reads more as a static label than a trait tested by internal conflict. His actions are logical and reveal his values, particularly the gentle reshaping of the comb. However, the internal journey lacks a moment of genuine contradictory impulse; the path to understanding is a little too smooth for a character-defining epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's character is consistent and her motivation is clear. The "wistfully pragmatic" trait is well-demonstrated through action, contrasting her sadness over the rose with her purposeful work. However, the narration occasionally slips into diagnostic self-awareness, as when it states, "It was a tone of protected vulnerability that defined her existence," which labels the core theme rather than letting it be fully embodied by her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal arc is consistent. However, the resolution relies on summarizing her emotional change with abstract labels like "it became a forge" and "Independence bloomed," rather than embodying the shift in a final, concrete perception or action. This use of diagnostic language, particularly in the closing beats, lessens the earned quality of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his defining trait, whimsy, is effectively dramatized in his choice to create the art installation. However, his interiority often relies on abstract labels ("weight of unspoken affections," "heart remained adrift") rather than embodied emotion. The final interaction with Mira feels frictionless; her immediate, perfect understanding and on-the-nose dialogue ("perhaps it's time to share your own") make his final, pivotal choice feel less like a struggle and more like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, marked by a potent and consistent internal conflict between hope and weary pragmatism. Her motivation is sharp and compelling, driving the plot without wavering. The story earns her final "small, cautious smile" by grounding it in the costly victory, showing a meaningful change from her initial burdened posture to one of vigilant satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's core contradiction—a claustrophobic explorer—is a strong premise, but its execution relies more on labels ("prudently adventurous," "wistful rebellion") than on contradictory impulses shown in scene. His motivation is clear, but the final emotional change feels granted by the magical event rather than earned through a difficult internal choice. The final "wistful sorrow" is an interesting nuance, but the preceding interiority doesn't quite lay the groundwork for this specific, complex reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character concept is strong, but the internal change feels declared rather than dramatized. The story repeatedly uses diagnostic labels like "dormant empathy" and "detachment," culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes his emotional shift ("awakened his own heart"). The central conflict between his methodical nature and nascent empathy is undermined when the methodical work is skipped in favor of an intuitive leap, making his final transformation feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, her core internal conflict is articulated through the repetitive label "nervously confident" rather than being fully embodied in contradictory actions or perceptions. This descriptor is stated four times, functioning more as a summary than a dramatized internal state, which slightly flattens the character's interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s motivation is explicitly and repeatedly stated rather than dramatized. Phrases like “his dynamically observant nature kicking in” and his goal “to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” read as thematic labels, not embodied character traits. The emotional arc is asserted through these high-concept terms, leading to a resolution that feels more like a conceptual conclusion than an earned, personal transformation rooted in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear, but his central trait of "polished calm" is more often stated as a label than embodied through contradictory impulses. The character reads as highly competent and self-aware, which lessens the feeling of struggle in the final confrontation. His final choice is intellectually consistent but lacks a visceral, on-page sense of internal conflict being overcome in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Key traits are delivered as labels, such as "Elara, ever the healer," which preempts any dramatized action. Her internal state is summarized rather than embodied, making the final resolution feel more like a foregone conclusion than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elowen’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and drive the narrative. The concept of "warlike serenity" is a strong anchor for her character. However, the final change feels slightly over-articulated, shifting from embodied experience ("felt her own barriers unbend") to a diagnostic summary ("revelations of her soul's unseen depths"), which slightly lessens the impact of her earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary attribute ("purposefully curious") and emotional state ("anxious elation") are often stated as labels rather than fully embodied through action or unique perception. The final choice is logically sound but lacks a deep sense of internal struggle, reading more as an inevitable fulfillment of her stated trait than a difficult, contradictory decision made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the plot forward effectively. However, her core traits—"reckless idealist," "fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve"—are asserted through labels more often than they are dramatized through difficult, contradictory choices. While her final action aligns with these traits, the interiority reads as a summary of pre-defined characteristics rather than a lived, complex experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation and internal conflict are well-established, particularly the "insulating emotionally with facts" mechanism. However, the climactic realization is articulated with too much diagnostic self-awareness ("he realized his motivation...wasn't in appraising others' relics, but in honoring his own"). This therapy-speak flattens the emotional peak, telling the reader an insight that should have been embodied in a choice or image with more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his "kindly methodical" nature is demonstrated through action. However, the internal conflict feels more sequential than simultaneous; grief gives way to methodical action which leads to peace, rather than these impulses competing in a single moment. The final emotional shift to being "at peace" is earned by the story's logic but feels slightly too tidy, resolving the character's haunted state with near-perfect efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. His character is archetypal—the eternal guardian—and powerfully realized within that frame. However, the story bypasses true internal conflict; the contradictions exist in the identities he handles, not within him. The "fluctuating identity" tied to the moon feels more like an external label that conveniently enables his success rather than an internal struggle he must manage, which keeps this from the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the transformation from a solitary inspector with "walls built around his heart" to a bearer of hope feels abrupt. The "sudden, profound longing" is asserted rather than fully dramatized, making his final resolve feel more like a thematic requirement than a deeply earned psychological shift. The emotional arc is overly tidy, lacking the contradictory impulses expected in overcoming deep-seated trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is sharp and consistently drives the narrative. The internal conflict is clear, and his final action—playing the accordion—is an earned expression of his shift. However, the interiority occasionally relies on diagnostic labels like "fractured spirit" or "unfiltered emotions surging," which slightly blunt the specificity of his raw state rather than fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. The internal conflict between her "cautious exuberance" is present and sustained. However, the story tends to label this emotional state directly rather than fully embodying it through contradictory actions or sensory details, which keeps the characterization from feeling deeply particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized. The story relies heavily on summary ("deep purple sorrow") rather than embodied emotion, making her journey feel intellectual rather than visceral. The resolution, which grants her both dream and duty, undermines the gravity of her initial choice and feels emotionally unearned, weakening the character's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively. The final moment of self-reflection adds a necessary layer of depth, preventing her from being merely a functionary of the plot. However, her characterization is so tightly focused on her role and competence that it lacks a compelling internal contradiction or flaw demonstrated in-scene, keeping it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her defined trait of being "kindly decisive." However, her interiority trends toward summary, and the final realization feels more like an articulated thesis statement than a messy, embodied epiphany. The lack of demonstrated internal contradiction or struggle before the tidy resolution keeps this from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict is well-defined, and his shift from professional detachment to personal recognition is earned by the scene's pressure. However, the characterization leans on explicit labels like "sincerely insincere" and "protected vulnerability" rather than fully embodying these states through subtext. The final realization lands, but the path to it feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the scene's pedagogical structure. Lir functions more as a receptive vessel than a character with deep internal conflict, though his brief frustration is a good touch. Elara's final self-revelation provides a strong anchor for her character, but the overall dynamic lacks the friction of two fully realized, contradictory individuals acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The skimmer’s motivation is exceptionally clear and tied directly to the world’s core affliction, providing a solid foundation. However, his interiority tends toward summary ("a deeper unrest stirred," "motivation sharpened into clarity") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. While his archetype is consistent and his final resolve is earned, the characterization lacks the granular, flawed humanity that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but his characterization lacks depth. The internal conflict is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory choices in the scene; once he resolves to act, his path is linear and his success feels preordained, softening the impact of his final emotional breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is singular and compelling, driving every action from the inciting incident to the climax. The interiority is lyrical and consistent with the story's mythic tone, and his final transformation is earned by his decisive choices. The characterization lacks deep internal conflict—his journey is one of pure, unopposed seeking—which keeps it from the highest tier, but his purpose is clear and credibly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, anchored by the compelling internal contradiction between her "quietly enthusiastic resolve" and "stellar doubt." This conflict is not just stated but dramatized through her ritualistic actions, culminating in a credible character change. The motivation to "wavelength align" is clear, but the phrase itself feels slightly abstract and less embodied than the potent concept of "stellar doubt."

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper's motivation is clear and potent, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict between immortal duty and mortal grief provides a strong foundation. However, the interiority relies on abstract, high-concept labels like "ethereal heart shattered" and "distant intimacy" rather than specific, embodied sensations, which keeps the character at a slight remove from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the internal conflict feels more stated than dramatized. Traits like "brittle devotion" are repeatedly labeled, but Elandor overcomes his doubt without a visible struggle or costly trade-off. The final line, "the lukewarm mage transformed," asserts a change that isn't fully earned on the page through a difficult, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistent and drives the narrative, but the interiority occasionally relies on overly articulated self-awareness. The realization that "The action he needed was clear" and the decision "to expunge not the memory itself, but the isolation it had bred" feels more like a tidy summary of a complex emotional process than an embodied, in-the-moment discovery, which slightly undermines the climax's raw emotional power.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's internal conflict between logic and sentimentality is clearly established and drives her actions. However, the resolution of this conflict is articulated with diagnostic clarity in a peak moment ("Elara felt the convergence: logic... intuition..."), which tells the reader the outcome rather than allowing them to experience it through embodied action. This moment of summary slightly undermines an otherwise strong portrayal of a character bridging two worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot. The story effectively demonstrates her competence under pressure; however, her interiority reads as slightly generic for a high-stakes crisis. The internal conflict is more a statement of pressure ("the watcher's burden pressed upon her") than a dramatized, contradictory struggle, making her feel more like a flawless archetype than a person with complex limits.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kai's motivation to overcome his numbness is clear and consistent, providing a strong throughline. The internal conflict is externalized well through the clone, who embodies the passion Kai lacks. However, the clone feels more like a symbolic counterpoint than a fully realized character, and the final surge of emotion feels slightly asserted ("warmth flood his veins") rather than fully earned through a more granular, embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation to "safeguard" his creative space is clear and consistent, driving the entire internal plot. However, his interiority verges on being overly articulate, particularly when he explicitly names his own cognitive process ("approach the puzzle through orthogonal approaches"), which reads less like an organic thought and more like diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undermines the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, born from his unique identity as a "leaf blower symphony conductor." His defining trait, "mournfully eager," effectively captures a potent internal contradiction. The story successfully earns his final state of stasis, but the on-page portrayal of his internal conflict remains a sustained, singular state rather than a dynamic struggle between contradictory impulses in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guardian's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling. Its internal conflict between homesickness and the need for acceptance is well-dramatized through the ritual. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic phrasing ("to make friends with uncertainty," "What if displacement was not loss but transformation?"), which slightly undermines the "feral" aspect and reads more as authorial thesis than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the execution relies heavily on repeatedly labeling him "stoically sensitive" rather than fully embodying these contradictory traits through varied action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions effectively. The characterization is strong, but the interiority occasionally relies on summarizing her philosophy ("to find the beginning in every ending, a philosophy born…") rather than purely embodying it, which slightly lessens its impact in key reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is a functional archetype, not a character. His "resiliently positive" nature is a static label that pre-empts any internal conflict or credible struggle; he feels a "thrill rather than fear," which flattens the emotional stakes. His motivation is asserted ("surged") rather than earned, and his competence is absolute, making him a device to execute the plot rather than a person experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully established and consistently drives his actions. The character’s arc from a methodical pursuer of a feeling to someone who achieves a peaceful acceptance is earned and legible. The final emotional shift feels authentic, supported by the preceding accumulation of pressure and the cost of the "spent" sinew thread.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between wonder and melancholy is well-realized. The characterization is strong, particularly in how his trait of "balancedly curious" is demonstrated through his meticulous actions rather than just stated. The final vow feels earned, showing a crystallization of his stance. The repeated use of the phrase "somber marvel" slightly flattens the interiority, reading more as a label than a deeply embodied state in its second appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies too heavily on summarizing labels provided by the prompt (e.g., "unyielding motivation," "persistently curious"). The critical moment of realization is also summarized with a diagnostic label: "she realized the heroism unfolding," which undercuts the embodied experience. The final, subtle change—"her own heart mending slightly"—is earned and effective, but the overall characterization lacks the specific, contradictory impulses of a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Alex's motivation is clear, and the internal conflict with claustrophobia is well-embodied and tested by the setting, particularly in the flooded tunnel scene. However, the initial motivation "to stand by the unremembered" feels slightly abstract until it crystallizes into a concrete goal. The resolution of his phobia ("momentarily conquered") and the thematic summary ("found a piece of himself") feel a bit too neat and declared, slightly undercutting the earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Alex's motivation is clear and his core tic—counting heartbeats—is well-embodied and pays off at the end. However, the character's internal journey feels too linear and resolves with unearned tidiness. The final epiphany is articulated with diagnostic clarity ("his own 'death' was not erasure but a rebirth"), replacing a genuinely complex emotional progression with a tidy thematic summary, which undercuts the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storyteller's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from the setup to the climax. His interiority is conveyed through his singular focus and his reinterpretation of the "curse" as a tool, which is a strong character-revealing choice. However, the character reads more as a mythic archetype or a vessel for the story's concept rather than a deeply complex individual, which is acceptable for this length but prevents the highest score.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly established and compelling, rooted in bitterness and a "hope that refused to die." However, the final emotional transformation is more summarized than embodied. The line "Bitterness ebbed, transmuting into a cosmic joke" acts as diagnostic label-speak, telling the reader the emotional outcome rather than dramatizing the complex, contradictory feelings of such a profound change as it happens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, compelling her final actions. However, her interiority, particularly the "gap between knowing and understanding," remains somewhat abstract rather than being dramatized through contradictory impulses in the scene. The transformation from passive observer to active agent is earned, but feels more like a logical progression than a complex internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization relies more on stated labels like "respectfully rebellious" than on complex, embodied interiority. His internal thoughts align too neatly with the story's thematic keywords ("foster," "linking absences"), making him feel more like a vehicle for the theme than a person with contradictory impulses. The secondary character (the woman) serves her function but has little presence beyond advancing the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's core trait of "quietly persistent" is well-established, but the climactic transformation feels more magical than earned. The leap from lifelong silence to song is triggered by an external object's "warmth," an unearned epiphany that bypasses the deeper internal contradictions and struggle expected for such a profound change. The motivation shifts cleanly from practical (timber) to mystical, but the final character state arrives too suddenly to feel fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively. Her "sanely eccentric" nature is demonstrated through her unorthodox methods, moving beyond mere labels. However, the interiority occasionally leans into over-articulation, stating its own conceptual framework (e.g., "stories weren't linear paths but hyperbolic journeys") rather than letting the specific actions carry the full weight of the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, high-register labels like "luminous absence" and "cipher of longing." These function more as thematic declarations than as specific, embodied emotions, which keeps the characterization at a slight remove and prevents her internal contradictions from feeling fully dramatized in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, providing a strong narrative engine. However, the interiority relies on abstract labels ("improbable longing," "enigmatic figure") rather than specific, embodied sensations. The trait "unassumingly bold" is stated more than demonstrated, functioning as a narrative shortcut to explain his perseverance rather than a quality revealed through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the initial setup to the final action. Her core trait, "chronically curious," credibly explains both her youthful folly and her mature return. However, the internal conflict feels more summarized than dramatized; the shift from a "safe academia" mindset to chartering a submersible is asserted rather than shown through a moment of difficult choice, slightly flattening her arc from a state of avoidance to one of confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael's transformation from snarling defiance to resilient acceptance is too rapid to be credible, reading as a plot necessity rather than an earned character arc. His change is described with diagnostic labels like "resilience bloomed quietly within him," which summarizes the intended effect rather than dramatizing the struggle. Elara is a consistent archetype, but Kael's swift compliance weakens the "crucible" of their interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elowen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, her characterization lacks depth due to the absence of internal conflict or meaningful struggle. Traits like "insatiably creative" are asserted more than demonstrated under pressure, and she proceeds to a clean victory without any visible trade-offs, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her final choice is well-earned, rooted in both her calling and the deeply personal stake of her ancestor's unrest. The internal conflict is present, particularly her guilt over delaying the ritual. However, her emotional state is characterized by the repeated label "lucid unrest," which feels more like a diagnostic assertion than an embodied, contradictory experience, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The characterization of Elias is consistent and his motivation is clear. However, his interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels ("shielded yet open," "methodically curious") rather than fully dramatized internal conflict. The final shift to empathy is conceptually earned, but the preceding struggle feels more like a steady, intellectual progression than a crucible of contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait ("quietly analytic") is consistently demonstrated through his actions. However, the final emotional shift feels more intellectually articulated than embodied. Phrases like "the inertia of loss, the velocity of release" verge on diagnostic self-awareness, making the epiphany feel more like solving a mathematical proof than experiencing a profound, messy emotional change.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elowen's motivation is clear but stated more than embodied; phrases like "His motivation burned brightly" are label-only feelings. Lira's character is a functional convenience; her "instinctive" understanding and immediate kinship feel unearned, weakening the emotional core of the resolution. The story relies on asserting emotional states rather than dramatizing them through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his final choice is a credible outcome of his journey. However, his interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic labels like "warmly inquisitive" and "affectionate detachment" rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses shown in scene. This declarative style keeps the reader at a distance, summarizing his internal state rather than allowing us to experience it. The character arc is present, but its rendering lacks the specificity and nuance required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear, potent, and drives the entire narrative. His interiority is specific, particularly in his unique method of categorizing clouds, which externalizes his grief effectively. The transformation from "quietly explosive grief" to "quiet peace" is earned through the story's central action. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated interiority, such as defining his motivation as a need to "validate that absences weren't erasures but silent archives," which reads more like a thematic summary than an organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-dramatized through her struggle with the fractal coin. Her face blindness is not just a trait but a core part of her perceptual signature that informs the story's central challenge. The final shift to "strange peace" is earned by the preceding struggle, representing a credible change with a clear cost—the abandonment of her initial, more naive goal.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, and the central trait of curiosity drives the narrative effectively. However, the interiority occasionally relies on stock phrasing ("His motivation burned bright," "His heart raced") rather than more specific, embodied emotion. The final transformation of his loneliness into "sociable isolation" is earned, but the character lacks a deeper internal conflict or contradiction that would elevate him beyond a well-executed archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on nostalgic summary rather than in-scene contradictory impulses. While the yearning is palpable, her emotional progression feels linear, moving from longing to discovery without a significant internal struggle or trade-off. The final tears are a good embodied touch, but the character arc lacks the complexity expected for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The characters function as archetypes fulfilling plot roles—leader, skeptic, healer—rather than as individuals with complex interiority. Motivation is clear but lacks depth; Jax's skepticism is introduced and then immediately dismissed by Lena's assertion ("feel it in your bones"), bypassing any genuine internal conflict or earned change. The "unbreakable bonds" are declared upfront, which lessens the impact of their need to "reexamine divisions," as the struggle feels minimal and the outcome preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear, consistent, and well-embodied in his "beautifully flawed hands" and solitary vigil. The interiority is rich with a specific emotional texture ("bruised awe"). However, the characterization lacks a potent internal conflict in the present moment; his sorrow and purpose are resolved into a single, consistent state of bittersweet acceptance, which, while poignant, misses an opportunity for a more dynamic inner struggle or a contradictory impulse during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by a potent and consistently dramatized internal conflict between reluctant duty and a desire for freedom. Elara’s interiority is specific, particularly the "offhandedly exact quality" of her mind, which is shown in action rather than just told. The final beat, where she feels a "raw, unpolished satisfaction" before accepting her "beautiful burden," achieves a resonant Earned Stasis, a resolution that is both costly and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on overly articulated, almost diagnostic self-awareness (e.g., "translate that painful separation into some form of connection"). While the central metaphor of her profession is well-integrated, her emotional state is often described with labels rather than embodied through contradictory impulses, slightly softening the impact of her earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and drives the entire narrative arc, culminating in a costly transformation that feels earned within the story's logic. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract conceptual labels ("mindfully scattered," "integrated fragmentation") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. She functions more as a very effective vessel for the story's theme than a character with deep, particularized texture.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific backstory of remorse. However, the internal conflict at the climax feels more conceptual than embodied. The resolution—channeling sorrow and refining it like a broth—is an intellectual summary that sidesteps the messier, contradictory emotional struggle one would expect, reading as a form of "emotional arithmetic" that resolves too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara's character is defined by descriptive labels ("harmonious choral librarian," "empathetic decisiveness," "vigorous tender resolve") rather than earned through action under pressure. Her motivation is clear, but her internal state lacks contradiction or struggle; her path is linear and her success feels preordained. The story tells us she is decisive and resolute, as in "her empathetic decisiveness cut through hesitation like a gentle blade," but we never witness the hesitation that is being cut, making her feel more like an archetype than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, but his interiority suffers from over-articulation. Elias's self-awareness feels diagnostic, using terms like "synaptic plasticity" mid-reverie, which reads less like an engineer in crisis and more like a narrator explaining a concept. This "diagnostic label-speak" undercuts the emotional struggle, making his transformation feel more like a planned intellectual exercise than an earned, messy breakthrough with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, her interiority relies on labels like "latent blaze" and "prism-minded" rather than fully embodied emotion or thought processes. The climactic moment where her "mind refracted the danger: dodge left, use the manuscript, exploit the inversion" reads as a diagnostic summary rather than a genuine, contradictory internal experience under pressure, limiting the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on abstract labels like "symphonically minded" rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her interiority feels more like a thematic statement than a specific, personal experience, especially in the line "feeling the core concept of empathy in motion stir within her." While her actions are aligned with her motives, she reads as a symbolic vessel for the story's ideas rather than a complex individual navigating a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal transformation is well-earned through the story's central action. His interiority is specific to his character as a chess master. However, the voice occasionally slips into overly diagnostic self-awareness ("both rooted in fear of vulnerability"), which slightly undermines the embodiment of his emotional state mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, but the execution relies heavily on labels ("eclectic pacifist," "theatrical sincerity") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. His internal state is described more than it is embodied, and the repeated phrase "theatrical sincerity" functions as a summary that flattens the character's complexity instead of revealing it through action or specific, contradictory micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the peak moment. The resolution feels somewhat tidy, summarized in the line "Her ambition fulfilled, she cultivated serenity," which bypasses the messy work of embodying such a change. While her actions (journaling, enduring the stench) align with her motives, the final shift lacks the embodied cost of a truly earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains one-dimensional. She is an archetype of the "intrepid pilot" whose competence is never seriously challenged by internal conflict or a meaningful flaw. The story lacks moments of contradictory impulse; her interiority serves only to reinforce her established goal without adding complexity or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is a functional, competent protagonist whose motivation is explicitly and consistently stated. Her actions align perfectly with her goals, creating a clear throughline. However, she lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction; her interiority is rational and analytical, reading more like a summary of professional competence than the embodied experience of a person in a disaster zone. The characterization is clear but lacks the depth and flaw that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is explicit and consistent, but lacks compelling internal conflict; she is a capable functionary executing her purpose. Her primary character trait, synesthesia, is well-dramatized, but her internal state is more often labeled with the repeated phrase "oscillating repose" than embodied through contradictory impulses in the scene. The character serves the concept beautifully but reads as a vessel for the theme rather than a complex individual wrestling with a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and consistently drives her actions. The final change from solitary keeper to alliance-builder is earned through the ritual's revelations. However, the explicit, repeated phrasing of her goal—"to harvest insights from failure"—borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the interiority which is otherwise solid.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action, creating a tight narrative engine. The internal conflict between the desire for mathematical order and the experience of emotional chaos is well-dramatized. However, the embodiment of the transposed emotions occasionally relies on summary ("a storm of love and rage that defied quantification") rather than purely lived-in sensory detail, which slightly distances the reader from the peak crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the central action effectively. Her "jitteriness" is given a nice paradoxical source—both fear and purpose. However, her interiority relies heavily on summary and emotional labels ("motivation burned steady," "jitteriness easing") rather than embodied, contradictory experience, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions are well-aligned with her "firmly grounded" mysticism. Marcus serves as an effective secondary pressure point. The characterization is slightly weakened by the abstract declaration, "But Elara's tone was one of truthful lies," which labels her core contradiction rather than fully embodying it through action and subtext alone, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, providing a strong narrative engine. However, interiority relies heavily on repeated, abstract labels like "wistful" and "stoically sparkling" rather than embodied, particular experience. This flattens the character, making her feel more like a vessel for the theme of sacrifice than a person experiencing it; the core is solid, but the execution of her inner life is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elar’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. The core conflict between being “meek” and “determined” is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult choice; his actions are driven solely by determination without any visible struggle against his meekness. Interiority tends toward summary ("unassuming nature hiding a resolve") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, the interiority is a significant weakness, relying heavily on abstract, thematic statements ("She visualized the withheld truth as a knotted strand") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. Elara's internal state often reads as an explanation of the story's concepts rather than a specific, personal experience, which flattens her character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted effectively in his reticent, observant nature and a desire to "bottle safety." The connection between his quiet duty and his hidden griefs lands well at the climax. However, the explicit reveal of his lost wife and child arrives very late, feeling more like a convenient justification for the peak emotional moment rather than a sorrow that has shaped his perception throughout the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear but her interiority relies on stated labels like "shadowed elation" rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses shown in-scene. She reads as a competent archetype performing a function, with no visible struggle, flaw, or internal conflict complicating her actions. The characterization is consistent but lacks the depth and vulnerability expected for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored well to the donor heart. However, his characterization relies more on stated attributes ("watchful," "quietly explosive") than on demonstrating contradictory impulses through in-scene choices. The final transformation feels more like an intellectual acceptance of the theme than a deeply earned personal shift that comes with a visible cost, making him a slightly passive vessel for the story's ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is established clearly and consistently as a "quiet obsession." However, his internal journey feels slightly less earned than his external one. The realization of how to use the sextant—"The method came to him intuitively"—is a narrative shortcut, and the final healing of his own sorrows is asserted in the last two paragraphs rather than fully dramatized through his specific actions or memories. The characterization is strong but relies on summary at pivotal emotional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and fierce, providing a strong narrative engine. However, her interiority relies on abstract labels like "scattered" and "bound" rather than demonstrating these states through contradictory impulses or specific, embodied perception in the moment. The final change to being "made whole" feels more asserted than earned, as the ritual proceeds without any sign of internal struggle or a difficult choice that reorders her values.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("absorb the emotions of others like a sponge") and overly-articulate epiphanies. The final realization reads less like an earned, in-the-moment insight and more like a tidy thematic summary ("hiding revealed truths, and reclusion birthed compassion"). This abstraction keeps the characterization from achieving truly embodied depth, despite the strong conceptual foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation for "tenuous absolution" is clear and consistent. However, the interiority relies heavily on repeating abstract labels like "creeping normality noticer" and "heuristically gentle." This makes his internal state feel overly diagnosed and less organically embodied, preventing the contradictory impulses from feeling fully dramatized in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core trait of "gently meticulous" is demonstrated through action. However, her interiority is somewhat one-dimensional, expressing urgency and sadness without significant internal conflict or contradiction. The final trembling of her hands provides a nice moment of embodied emotion, but the character arc remains linear and lacks the complexity needed for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, a compelling blend of vengeance and a unique, sensory-driven quest for closure. Her actions align perfectly with this internal drive. However, her emotional state is occasionally described with summary labels ("motivation burned quietly," "resolve") rather than being fully embodied in contradictory, in-scene perception, which slightly softens the impact of her internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her core trait of being a "skeptic" is asserted more than it is demonstrated. Her immediate and proficient use of a mystical, taste-activated compass undercuts this supposed skepticism, making her final conversion feel less like a costly change and more like an inevitable outcome. The characterization is functional but lacks the internal friction promised by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, but his interiority occasionally relies on summary and diagnostic labels ("convinced that art was a frivolous pursuit," "it had only corked his soul") instead of fully embodied emotion. The character’s core conflict is compelling and his final action is earned. The slight tendency to tell rather than show the psychological state prevents it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions logically. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing, particularly at the climax. The emotional resolution ("mending the parched voids in her soul") is more declared than embodied, a diagnostic summary that slightly undercuts the earned power of the preceding discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. Her traits, like "muted vigor," are well-embodied in her dedicated work. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict; her journey is one of pure, unopposed artistic resolve rather than a struggle against contradictory impulses or meaningful self-doubt, which keeps it from the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the final emotional resolution feels more stated than earned. The line "the Botanist's fears no longer a burden but a bridge to empathy" is a diagnostic summary that slightly undercuts the preceding struggle. The internal conflict is well-established, but its resolution is articulated with a tidiness that feels external to the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains thin. She functions more as a flawless catalyst for the community's healing than a protagonist with a compelling internal struggle. Her own "softening" grief is stated rather than dramatized, lacking the contradictory impulses or embodied emotion expected in high-caliber fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but overly articulated, relying on thematic labels like "encrypt vulnerability as strength" instead of dramatized internal conflict. Her "calm defiance" is asserted but never truly tested by a setback, making her competence feel absolute rather than earned. The character reads as a vessel for a concept; her internal state is summarized with diagnostic precision rather than embodied in contradictory actions or perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as a powerful engine for the plot. However, the interiority occasionally relies on summary or diagnostic labels, such as when his feelings are described as mirroring "the voids in his mind where memories had been deleted." This slightly abstracts his internal state, making him more of a vessel for the story's compelling concept than a fully embodied character with contradictory impulses shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, and the internal state of a "tranquil blaze" is a compelling contradiction. However, the interiority relies more on elegant labels than on embodied, moment-to-moment experience. The final shift from "blaze" to "embers" is effective but feels more like a summary of change than a dramatized, contradictory process felt in-scene, keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative from the contrived excuse to the final interrogation. The internal conflict between his desire to believe and his creeping doubts is well-established, culminating in a choice that feels earned. Mira is an effective mentor figure, though her interiority remains opaque, which serves the story's mystery. The relationship is the clear crucible for the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies more on declarative labels ("charmed skeptic," "skepticism warring with charm") than on embodied experience. The internal conflict is stated effectively but not dramatized with contradictory micro-choices in the key moment of action. The final transformation feels earned by the plot, but the internal process reads more as an articulated summary ("her skepticism had been a shield") than a visceral, in-scene struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but the execution of her internal shift relies on over-articulated summary rather than embodied discovery. The climactic epiphany—"accepting that his abandonment was not betrayal, but a calibrated retreat"—reads as a diagnostic label, a tidy intellectual conclusion that lacks the messy, contradictory feeling of a genuine emotional breakthrough under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, anchored effectively by the backstory of her mother. However, Thorne’s characterization is thin; he serves as a necessary obstacle whose defenses and motivations feel convenient for the plot. His swift turn from guarded intriguer to a confessor with "reed-like sorrow" is abrupt and less earned than Elara's own resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives her actions consistently. The characterization is strong, particularly in her specific, nuanced value system ("weave it carefully"). However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels rather than fully embodied emotion, and a more potent internal contradiction, acted out in-scene, would elevate her from a highly competent professional to a more deeply complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative arc. Elias's interiority is rich, but at times it verges on the overly articulate, presenting fully-formed thematic statements rather than contradictory, in-the-moment thoughts. The final change—the vow—is earned by the preceding reflection, but the journey to it lacks a moment of genuine struggle or internal conflict, reading as a smooth, inevitable progression toward enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's motivation is established with clarity and propels every action, from his initial skepticism to his methodical reassembly of the letters. The final beat presents a powerful internal conflict, pitting his lifelong professional drive against a new, devastating moral weight. This transformation from a simple debunker to the holder of a world-altering choice is earned and lands with significant impact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal conflict feels more summarized than dramatized. The transition from a "lonely visionary" to a movement's beacon is shown as an inevitable ascension rather than a process involving difficult micro-choices or visible trade-offs. While his final allegiance is earned within the story's logic, the lack of a moment of genuine doubt or a tempting alternative path slightly flattens the arc from a characterizational standpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is clearly stated but remains an abstract thesis rather than a dramatized, felt need. Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels like "positively wistful ache" and summaries of belief ("redemption wasn't bestowed but gleaned"). There is no visible internal conflict; he proceeds toward his goal without friction, contradiction, or a difficult choice, making the final emotional uplift feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his backstory, providing a solid foundation. However, his core trait of being "logically emotional" is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory actions. The climax describes a "logically emotional surge" which functions as a diagnostic label, weakening the interiority by telling instead of showing the internal conflict. His final confrontation with his own guilt feels somewhat abrupt, more of an epilogue than an earned culmination of an internal struggle shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her core internal conflict—"restrained wildness" versus patient observation—is more stated than dramatized. The other exiles serve as a generic sounding board for her philosophy rather than applying meaningful pressure. The characterization is competent but relies on declarative labels for interiority instead of fully embodying the contradiction in a tangible choice or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic labels like "fortified vulnerability" and "quantum-like links." This therapy-speak flattens her emotional experience, telling the reader her state rather than embodying it through contradictory impulses in the scene. The final change is earned by the plot, but the internal journey feels more summarized than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character motivations are clear, but the emotional progression is unconvincing. Lena's shift from years of anger to forgiveness is abrupt and externally triggered rather than earned through a difficult internal process. Her dialogue, especially the line "do I deserve to let it go, or should I hold you accountable forever?", functions as a thematic summary rather than natural speech, a form of diagnostic label-speak that undermines her credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization itself lacks depth. Elias functions more as a necessary vehicle for the story's inventive concepts than as a person with compelling internal contradictions. His "steadily curious nature" and "irreverent awe" are stated more than they are embodied in choices made under pressure, resulting in a character who is functional but emotionally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, "brightly attentive," is demonstrated rather than merely stated, directly enabling the plot's inciting incident. Her pivotal choice to lie to the AI is a strong character moment that aligns perfectly with her obsessive drive. The interiority is functional, but lacks the deeper contradictory impulses that would elevate it to an exceptional level; her path feels determined rather than fraught with internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives her actions. However, her characterization relies on asserted labels like "courageous anomaly" and "calmly intuitive" rather than dramatizing these traits through flawed choices or internal contradiction. The emotional progression is linear and competent, lacking the friction of a genuine internal struggle against her own impulses during the pivotal reconstitution scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from a passive death-wish to an active search for meaning. Her interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly her altered sensory state, which avoids cliché. The final change feels earned, a direct result of the accumulated pressure, and the cost of renouncing her old quest is made tangible in the "fold" of her long-held patience.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    Characterization is consistent but lacks deep specificity, relying on archetypes like the "gentle soul" and the "fleeing traveler." Motivation is overly articulated, particularly with the line "his motivation clear: to foster this intersubjective bond," which replaces embodied action with a label. Mira's self-diagnosis of being "destined mismatches, pulled apart by timing and temperament" feels too self-aware and analytical for an authentic moment of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elar's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks meaningful internal conflict or flaw. His defining trait of being "strangely honest" is demonstrated in a single, on-the-nose line rather than through a difficult choice with consequences. He reads as a competent functionary executing a task rather than a character struggling with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels ("perceptively calm," "earnest whimsy") rather than dramatized internal conflict. She functions more as a serene catalyst for others' change than a protagonist with her own complex interiority or flaws. The story misses an opportunity for her to face a moment of doubt or have her own calm tested by the community's raw grief.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's character is consistent, and his core trait of reticence directly and satisfyingly informs the story's resolution—his choice of quiet demonstration over proclamation. His motivation is clear and drives the narrative. However, the characterization leans heavily on the "reticent scholar" archetype, and descriptors like "weathered innocence" feel more like labels than deeply embodied traits, keeping him from feeling fully singular.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently drives his actions. The internal conflict between his prophetic glimpses and his inability to retain them is well-dramatized through his methodical, ritualistic navigation. The final acceptance of the recurring "tidal longing" demonstrates an earned change in stance, moving from desperate seeking to a state of resonant, temporary peace.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and poignant, rooted in his grief. The "luminous ache" is a strong emotional anchor, but his final shift to "radiant peace" feels slightly abrupt and more declared than fully earned through embodied struggle. While his actions align with his motives, the internal resolution feels more like a conceptual shift than a messy, contradictory human process.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear but lacks internal contradiction; she is a flawless instrument of healing rather than a complex individual. The repeated label "decisively kind" functions more as a thematic assertion than an embodied trait tested by the scene. Elias's characterization is effective as a vessel for regret and redemption, but his transformation feels more received than earned due to Elara's perfect orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary character trait, "quietly deliberate," is stated three times rather than demonstrated through a choice with a meaningful trade-off. The interiority lacks specific, embodied emotion, relying on summary (e.g., "her motivation burned quietly") instead of showing contradictory impulses under pressure. While her actions are logical, the character feels more like a capable functionary for the plot than a person with complex inner turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on asserted labels ("forgiving skeptic," "shrewdly innocent") rather than dramatized, contradictory actions. Her internal conflict is described more than felt, and her final transformation into someone "forgiven and whole" feels too abrupt and unearned, coming from a magical vision rather than a difficult, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, creating a clear contrast between her fiery past and gentle present. Her internal conflict is dramatized through the central action of polishing the sea glass. However, the interiority occasionally leans on summary, as in the line "she discovered balance," which states the outcome of her struggle rather than fully embodying the contradictory impulses leading to it.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is well-established. However, her self-awareness occasionally dips into diagnostic language ("a core concept emerging," "protected vulnerability"), which feels more authorial than authentically in-character. The final connection is earned on a thematic level, but the character interaction itself feels slightly idealized and symmetrical, missing the messier contradictions of a real encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, and his central conflict—the creative act as both salvation and theft—is compelling. However, the conflict is often stated ("His conflict deepened with each acquisition") rather than fully embodied in contradictory actions or visceral emotional responses. The final decisive act is well-earned, but the interiority leading up to it relies on summary over nuanced, in-scene struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. His "whimsical" nature is stated more than demonstrated, save for a single chuckle. The core issue is the absence of a meaningful internal conflict or a difficult choice; he acts as a competent, near-flawless agent for the story's magic rather than a character struggling with contradictory impulses or genuine limitations, which flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions, particularly the physical embodiment of patience, are potent expressions of her will. However, her interiority occasionally relies on labeling emotion ("thrummed with the ache") rather than fully grounding it in embodied perception. While her singular focus is effective, the absence of any contradictory impulse or internal conflict slightly flattens the characterization, keeping it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the narrative. However, the characterization is more of a static portrait than a dynamic arc; his interiority is articulated with a philosophical self-awareness that verges on the diagnostic, as in the "cellar of reason" metaphor, which is explained rather than fully embodied. There is little internal contradiction or struggle, rendering him more of a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The weaver's motivation is clear, consistent, and evolves compellingly from balancing her prison to escaping it. The final choice to weave her own essence into the loom feels earned by the preceding ritual. The characterization is held back from a higher tier only by a lack of significant internal contradiction; her path is one of discovery and execution rather than a deep struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is clear and deeply integrated into her actions, with her interiority rendered in concrete, specific language like the title of widow feeling like "a borrowed coat." The internal conflict between grief and the will to find meaning is dramatized through the physical act of carving, making her emotional shift feel earned. The final state of "rust-hued peace" is a credible evolution, not a simplistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-defined. However, the climactic negotiation with her ghost resolves a bit too cleanly; the ghost's capitulation to the "rebuild from the silt" aphorism feels slightly unearned after the build-up of her failures, softening the cost of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but abstract ("equations for hope"), and her core traits ("curious," "stoic," "functionally creative") are repeatedly stated rather than consistently embodied. Her internal state is summarized with labels instead of being revealed through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. While her actions are consistent with her role, the character feels more like a vehicle for the theme than a complex individual facing a genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    The character's motivation is clear and the internal conflict is well-defined. Elias's introversion provides a solid psychological basis for his life choices, making his final act of acceptance feel earned. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels ("excruciatingly gentle release") rather than staying fully embodied, which slightly softens the emotional impact at its peak.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, the interiority relies more on declarative statements ("mirroring his introspective mood," "clarity crystallized") than on embodied, contradictory impulses acting in the moment. While the final change is earned, the emotional progression feels more intellectual and linear than viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, and his core attribute of patience is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The choice to "coax the secret forth gently" is a strong character beat that aligns perfectly with his established philosophy. The characterization is more archetypal than deeply personal, serving the story's concept effectively but lacking the sharp internal contradictions that would elevate it into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong anchor for the narrative. However, his interiority sometimes reads as overly articulate and conceptual (e.g., "geography of healing," "mapping how wounds mended"), bordering on diagnostic self-awareness rather than the embodied emotion of a person mid-ritual. This intellectual distance slightly mutes the emotional core, making his transformation feel more like a philosophical conclusion than a visceral shift.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prince's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the story's single-minded action. However, his interiority is severely flattened by the repetitive use of "hypothesized" as a label for thought, rather than dramatizing the thinking process itself. This tic turns a potentially complex internal state into a mechanical report, preventing the characterization from reaching a higher tier of specificity and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear but also explicitly stated, reading more like a thesis than an organic drive. Elara's interiority relies on abstract summaries ("ferocity born of empathy," "vow to heal") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses in the scene. The repeated use of labels like "unyielding compassion" serves to tell rather than show, making her feel more like a symbol than a person struggling in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's core contradiction—a luminous woman who is a skeptic—is clear and consistent. However, her defining traits ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative," "sidereal patience") are delivered through direct labels rather than being consistently embodied in nuanced action or thought. The motivation is strong, but her internal process reads more like a sequence of logical deductions than a genuine struggle between contradictory impulses, flattening the potential for deeper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a compelling backstory that justifies her gentle methods. Her interiority is particular, avoiding stock phrasing. However, the internal conflict between mourning and acting sometimes reads more as a summary of states rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene, which slightly softens the pressure on her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal transformation is well-earned. The shift from a static to a fluid understanding of his craft is compelling. The characterization is strong, but slightly held back by interiority that sometimes uses abstract, declarative labels ("whirlwind of calm intensity") instead of more grounded, contradictory embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is palpable, particularly the festering guilt. However, the characterization is held back by interiority that occasionally relies on diagnostic self-awareness, using abstract labels like "ethical burden" and "incremental absolution" which feel more asserted than embodied in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, progressing from simple curiosity to an empathetic desire for resolution. However, his defining trait of "blithe" is more stated than dramatized through conflicting impulses; his cheerfulness gives way to soft sympathy without a moment of genuine struggle or internal friction. The character arc is present but lacks the complexity that a deeper contradiction would provide.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is well-rendered, though it occasionally drifts into overly articulate, abstract labels like "the tone of sustaining transformation settling over her." This slightly undermines the embodied feel of her emotional state in the final beats, preventing a higher score, but her competence and determination are convincingly portrayed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but he lacks compelling internal conflict. His path to success is diligent but emotionally linear, without the contradictory impulses or flaws under pressure that would elevate a character from functional to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his final ritual. The internal conflict between curating illusions for others and confronting his own is palpable, culminating in the final scene. However, interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "The mask empowered him" rather than fully embodied emotion, which slightly distances the reader from his immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    The characterization is superb, with a clear motivation that drives the plot. The internal conflict between his rationalism and the "agony" of doubt is palpable. The transformation from a "wannabe philosopher" to one whose philosophy is "forged in the depths" is earned by the story's central discovery and his subsequent intellectual choice, marking a clear and costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's characterization is strong and consistent. Her core motivation is clear, and her internal state of being "expectantly resigned" is credibly dramatized through her patient, methodical actions rather than just being a label. The shift from resignation to a heart "buoyed by small victories" is earned through the story's progression. The secondary characters are archetypal, but this serves the story's focus on Elara's internal and external project at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, and his final change is earned through confronting his trauma. However, his characterization as an "informally wise" sage feels slightly idealized and lacks a sharp, contradictory flaw demonstrated in-scene. His internal conflict is more of a steady resolve against an external force, rather than a war within himself, which slightly flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thorne's motivation to "preserve wonder" is a strong anchor and justifies his choice to offer a riddle rather than a direct answer. However, Elara acts more as a functional protagonist, a vehicle for the plot, with limited interiority or contradictory impulses. The story states her world was "forever changed" but doesn't dramatize the internal cost of that change, making the emotional arc feel summarized rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    The character's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear, consistent, and drives every action. The interiority, described as a "hushed blaze," aligns perfectly with the tone. However, the characterization lacks a compelling internal conflict; Elias proceeds from curiosity to insight with very little friction, doubt, or contradictory impulse, which makes his journey feel slightly too linear and his success preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s internal conflict is stated clearly but resolved too neatly. The shift from "that changes nothing" to full acceptance is catalyzed by a magical elixir rather than a grueling internal choice, making the epiphany feel given rather than earned. Liriel functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a character, delivering insights with a "diagnostic label-speak" quality ("See how certainty's structure weakens without flexibility?") that flattens the emotional complexity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is nuanced and compelling, linking a metaphysical struggle to a specific human regret. Elias’s actions are consistent with his identity as a mathematician confronting a paradox. However, the story leans on labels like "grim optimist" and the repeated "balancedly daring," which slightly flatten the interiority by telling rather than purely showing these traits in action.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on declarative labels like "methodically hopeful" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. While his actions align perfectly with his stated goals, he reads more as a noble symbol for the theme than a complex individual struggling with genuine internal conflict. The backstory of the vendor gifting the brush also feels a bit too convenient, neatly proving his theory for him rather than letting him earn it through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted directly in her background. Her actions are decisive and aligned with her values. However, her interiority, while present, lacks the contradictory impulses or specific degradation under stress expected at the highest tier; her progression from fear to resolve feels a bit too linear and tidy for a crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in grief. His actions are consistent with his "neatly inventive" trait. However, the key emotional state of "bleak exhilaration" is stated three times, functioning more as a label than an embodied, evolving contradiction, which slightly flattens the interiority at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly linked to the inciting incident, providing a strong causal engine for the story. However, the interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic summary ("fear incarnate—his lifelong dread of abandonment...manifesting in that fatal arrhythmia"), which tells the reader the psychological stakes rather than letting them be fully embodied in the moment. While his actions are consistent, the character's internal struggle feels somewhat linear once the advisor provides the method.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prophet’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from the moment the threat is perceived. His interiority is fittingly mythic, felt through embodied sensations ("restless stirring in his bones") rather than complex psychologizing. The character is a strong archetype actualized through specific, skilled actions, though he lacks the deep internal contradiction that would elevate him into the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire causal chain, culminating in a choice that feels both inevitable and costly. Her core trait, "quietly driven," is well-demonstrated through her solitary work and final resolve. The characterization is held back from the highest tier only by an interiority that occasionally relies on labels like "inner fire" rather than fully embodying the character's contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and his core trait, "emotionally rational," is consistently stated. However, the execution feels more like a label than an embodied contradiction; phrases like "he channeled it rationally" summarize the internal conflict rather than dramatizing it. The decision-making process is a bit too tidy, lacking the friction of genuinely simultaneous, contradictory impulses acting in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his stated internal state. However, the reliance on descriptive labels like "stoically sensitive" (used twice) and a "hushed blaze" of feeling (used three times) reads as diagnostic summary rather than embodied contradiction. While his actions at the climax demonstrate these traits, the repeated labels undercut the interiority by telling the reader what to feel instead of letting the actions carry the full weight of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the plot, but her characterization relies on telling over showing. Attributes like "logical" and "tranquilly perceptive" are stated as labels rather than demonstrated through contradictory, in-scene choices. The final transformation into a "guardian of reclaimed histories" is summarized as an intellectual adjustment rather than felt as an earned, embodied emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    The motivation is potent and drives the entire narrative arc. However, the character's interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "luminous agony" rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses in the moment. The line where he murmurs his motivation aloud, "To fold grief into origami cranes," feels slightly too declarative, externalizing a thought that the scene's actions already make clear.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Amir's motivation is exceptionally clear, born from a vividly rendered trauma that grounds his esoteric quest. His internal conflict—the "bleak exhilaration" of pursuing a discovery born from immense loss—is sustained and embodied, particularly in the trembling fingers and pounding heart during the hunt. The final shift from a vengeful impulse to a purpose of "renewal" is earned by the preceding struggle, representing a credible change with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and linked to the central stake, but her primary character trait—"perpetual surprise"—is asserted repeatedly rather than embodied through varied action or specific internal contradiction. This label-only trait, mentioned five times, flattens her interiority into a performance of wonder rather than a complex emotional state. The pilgrim functions effectively as a catalyst but lacks distinct characterization beyond his archetypal role, making their interaction more transactional than relational.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, and his internal conflict between guilt and protective love is well-established. However, the interiority sometimes slips into diagnostic self-awareness, stating themes directly rather than embodying them. For instance, the realization that his lies "were shields, tempering regret into something bearable" feels more like an authorial summary than a raw, in-the-moment epiphany for a man in turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-grounded in his backstory of failure. His interiority feels specific, particularly how his trait of "uncommon thoughtfulness" translates into concrete actions like studying lunar cycles. The internal conflict between guilt and professional duty is palpable, and the final emotional shift feels earned. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated self-awareness, such as the repeated phrase "recycle into wisdom," which reads more like a thematic label than an organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation and internal conflict are strong and clear, particularly the "merrily melancholic" contradiction demonstrated through humming while crying. However, the interiority occasionally slips into over-articulated, diagnostic language ("to align heart and action," "misalignments in his soul") which slightly distances the reader from the raw emotion of the crisis, feeling more like a summary of the character's state than an immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between jadedness and curiosity is well-drawn. However, the final emotional breakthrough is slightly undercut by summary. The line "Empathy kindled slowly" tells the reader the outcome rather than allowing them to feel the shift through Alex's embodied experience in that final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, but her internal conflict feels more stated than dramatized. The transition from "reluctance" to surrender at the climax hinges on recalling the fortune's words, which reads as an intellectual decision rather than a deeply embodied, contradictory struggle. The fear of losing her "steady self" is mentioned as a stake, but the cost isn't rendered with enough friction to make her transformation feel like a true sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded in her new motherhood and past neglect. The internal conflict is present, but occasionally articulated with overly diagnostic language like "willingly perplexed" and "cloudbound repentance," which summarizes her state rather than fully embodying it. The final change to "willingly perplexed no more" feels slightly too neat, a label for a transformation rather than the transformation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "arduous integration" and "shadow of despair" instead of embodied, contradictory emotion. The core conflict of a pacifist containing rage is compellingly stated, but the process of resolving it feels too linear and tidy. The choice to "stitch" is a strong character-revealing action, but the emotional progression lacks the messy authenticity of genuine psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation as a giver is clear and consistent. However, his core drive "to understand the texture of transformation" is an abstract authorial construct rather than a grounded character goal. The final epiphany feels over-articulated and diagnostic ("transformation wasn't abrupt thunder, but a vibrant hush..."), summarizing the theme rather than embodying a hard-won, contradictory internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her defining trait, “calmly inventive,” is effectively dramatized. However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary (e.g., “her mind already weaving plans”) rather than embodied experience. While consistent, her flawless competence under pressure slightly lessens the feeling of immediate, personal risk, keeping the characterization strong but just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-defined. However, the resolution of her character arc feels overly tidy. The cost of her choice—losing her elusiveness—is immediately reframed as a positive ("rooted yet free"), which softens the emotional price of her sacrifice and makes the change feel less earned and more like a simple, clean transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, and the internal contradiction of being "furiously tranquil" is a strong anchor. However, his character arc relies heavily on the external stimulus of the mentor's map, making his final transformation feel more like a convenient epiphany than a deeply earned internal shift. The interiority sometimes relies on labels like "tempest of unspoken rage" rather than fully embodying the conflict through contradictory perceptions or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character concept of a "dueling philosopher" is well-realized through his actions and concise, philosophically-inflected dialogue. His defining trait, "diplomatically fierce," is effectively demonstrated in the duel's "polite as rebuttals" choreography. However, his internal conflict—the "dignified chaos"—is more declared than embodied, and his victory in the duel feels too frictionless to fully test his competence or reveal deeper vulnerabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established through the backstory with Jax, providing a solid anchor for his actions. The character is consistent, and his interiority reflects the story's lyrical tone. However, the central transformation—the "molt"—is more asserted than dramatized. We are told he "sensed this molt would birth a rebel," which pre-empts the tension of the change, making the final emergence feel inevitable rather than a choice forged in a moment of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the plot effectively. However, the interiority relies on labels like "wistful," "steely longing," and "strategically creative" rather than consistently showing these states through embodied action or perception. While his actions do demonstrate these traits, the direct statements slightly weaken the character's voice and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and her core internal conflict—doubt versus duty—is the engine of the story. The transformation of her doubt from a debilitating force into a "guiding force" provides a satisfying and earned character closure. While the interiority is strong, it occasionally leans on conceptual labels rather than fully embodied emotion, a minor point in an otherwise compelling portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The characterization is consistent, and the motivation is clear. Elias’s profession as a bonsai tutor provides a strong, integrated metaphor for the story's emotional process ("Prune the excess"). However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language, such as "Diffuse the ache by naming its hue— cerulean," which reads more like a therapeutic prescription than an organic emotional breakthrough, slightly reducing the moment's authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's motivation to preprocess reality is clear and rooted in her researcher traits, intensifying toward acceptance of chaos with a felt cost in her eroded detachment; interiority is concrete through embodied actions like kneeling by orchids and brushing dust, revealing contradictory impulses between observation and intervention. However, some emotional progression veers into abstract labels like "kindled humility," slightly undermining embodiment in peak reflections. The final choice to clear decay feels earned by prior accumulations, foreclosing her pure detachment with visible humility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to discover purpose is clear and intensifies through adaptive choices, like studying frost patterns, rooted in her traits as a resilient artist; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as tears welling at the discovery, showing contradictory impulses of loss and rebirth. Flaws complicate her journey without hedging, and micro-choices reveal values with felt cost in the climax. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, avoiding deeper irrationality mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies through her emotional investment, rooted in her violinist past and survival trauma; interiority is embodied in her focused emotions during the heat-mapping, showing contradictory impulses like grief and hope. However, some stock phrasing like "silently expressive eyes widening" borders on label-only without deeper contradiction in scene. The final renunciation of silence feels earned with visible emotional cost in her tears and poured memories.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's weary yet inadvertently stubborn nature is effectively shown through persistent actions like chanting rites amid chaos, revealing contradictory impulses of exhaustion and resolve that culminate in earned endurance with visible cost in his final sinking into the chair. Motivation intensifies compellingly to anchor spirits, rooted in traits without stock epiphanies. However, some emotions lean toward performed rather than deeply embodied, as in the "weary frame bent like a drowned willow" simile, which feels slightly clichéd.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to foster intergenerational support is clear and consistent, driving his shift from anonymity to declaration, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "gently persistent" without deeply embodied contradictions under pressure. The final choice feels earned through prior actions, yet lacks visible micro-choices revealing value hierarchies with felt cost. Strengths include his flaws complicating the reveal, as anonymity's loss reconfigures community bonds.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in spiritual curiosity, intensifying through the ritual to compel the release of unused love, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and deepening breaths showing internal conflict. However, interiority leans toward stock mystical phrasing, such as "spark ignited within her," without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of the past wound is earned with felt cost in tears and wholeness, but flaws feel somewhat abstracted rather than viscerally flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and intensifies compellingly, driving his hyperbolic maze envisioning to escape; interiority is concrete with embodied quaking and trembling, revealing contradictory awe and terror in the climax. However, emotions lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction in micro-choices, slightly softening the internal conflict's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to safeguard the seed vault is clear and intensifies through patient decoding under pressure, with embodied emotions shown in his precise movements despite chains; interior conflict emerges from his restrained elegance amid chaos, earning the final renunciation of freedom with visible cost in his temporary burden. However, some stock phrasing like "burned steady" slightly flattens interiority, though it doesn't undermine the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to capture the sound of trust breaking is rooted in his synesthetic gift and betrayal backstory, compelling his choices with embodied emotion like prickling skin from dividing cells; interiority shows contradictory impulses, such as reliving pain for healing, culminating in tears at the climax. The single-POV focus reveals flaws through his obsessive collection of absences, with micro-choices like hammering intents foreclosing paths at a felt cost. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored; the emotional progression layers regret and hope realistically without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to eavesdrop on destiny is clear and intensifies through her savvy traits, compelling the theft and reinterpretation with embodied doubt like the "pang" during the steal. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses, such as thievery versus the urge for change, culminating in an earned renunciation of her old life with felt cost in the final whispers. Strengths include concrete interiority rooted in flaws, avoiding stock epiphanies; weakness is minor therapy-speak in "luminous disbelief" that slightly abstracts emotion mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to craft safe zones is clear and rooted in his grief, intensifying through reflections that compel his final abandonment, with embodied emotions like wiping sweat and fingering the bookmark revealing contradictory impulses of sorrow and levity. Interior conflict shows in his thawing heart, aligning actions with motives without stock phrasing dominating. The bookmark as a relic enables a micro-choice to embed it, foreclosing pain with felt cost. However, some diagnostic self-awareness in metaphors like "iced-over heart" slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to embrace vulnerabilities as power is clear and intensifies through choices like decrypting the notes, but interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "claustrophobia" and stock phrasing without deeply embodied contradictions in scene. Emotions are summarized rather than shown through simultaneous impulses, weakening authenticity at the climax where he positions himself atop the shelf. Flaws complicate choices credibly, yet the resolution feels tidy without lingering moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oracle's motivation to map the endless night is clear and intensifies through her ritual actions, with mild obsession shown in persistent tracing despite trembling fingers and flaking gold. Interiority is concrete via embodied focus on silences, revealing contradictory impulses like quiet persistence amid storm chaos. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets ignored; the meaningful endurance forecloses paths with felt cost in the fading star's pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eko's motivation to find thought origins is clear and intensifies through the violin interaction, but interiority relies on abstract summaries rather than embodied contradictions, with emotions like curiosity feeling labeled instead of shown in conflicting impulses. The final realization feels earned yet lacks a visible micro-choice under pressure that reveals value hierarchy with cost. Composure trait constrains actions consistently, avoiding erratic behavior, but flaws don't compound into inevitable mistakes that heighten struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation to thaw mistrust is clear and intensifies toward the confrontation, with interiority rooted in Elias's past betrayal; emotions are embodied in trembling fingers and a felt pang, revealing contradictory impulses in his decision to reveal his own doodle. However, some stock phrasing like "guarded heart, frozen by a lover's deceit" edges toward therapy-speak, slightly undermining specificity. The final act of transparency earns a meaningful change with visible vulnerability as cost, aligning actions with motives effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to prove gardens recognize true care is clear and intensifies through pragmatic actions like the deception, rooted in his withered yet wise traits; interiority shows embodied contradictions in his feigned surrender versus secret mending, with micro-choices like polishing marbles revealing value hierarchies; the resolution earns his endurance by confronting low-luck flaws with visible cost in the garden's partial wither; strength lies in flaws complicating choices without hedging, as seen in his mended deceptions turning lies to truths.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characters Elara and Jax have clear motivations rooted in their roles, with Jax's obliging nature enabling the experiment's key choice, but interiority relies on stock traits like "brilliant head" without embodied contradictions under pressure. The relationship acts as a crucible, forcing the reversal with felt cost at the eddy threat, yet flaws like unearned gentleness in isolation feel one-note. Micro-choices reveal values, such as Jax's grunt during reversal, but emotional progression lacks credible irrationality.

    Elias's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and intensifies through his ethereal pull, driving choices like retrieving the program and playing discord; interiority is concrete via embodied sensations like itching fingers and attuned heart, with contradictory impulses in disrupting silence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Alex's motivation to unearth his swallowed truth about his father drives consistent choices, intensifying from exploration to confrontation with ghosts, with embodied contradictions like skepticism cracking under visions; however, interiority relies on somewhat stock phrasing like "heart raced" without deeper idiosyncratic embodiment, and the final renunciation feels earned but lacks a sharper visible cost in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The keeper's motivation to witness change without judgment is clear and consistent, driving his ritual journey, but interiority lacks embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure, remaining abstract and serene.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is rooted in her daughter's loss, embodied through the locket and adaptive methods that guide her interactions, culminating in the eclipse sharing that reveals her values with emotional cost. Finn feels somewhat stock as the apathetic boy, with reactions like skeptical listening trending toward summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene.

    Elias's motivation to collect wall-heard stories is clear and intensifies through his probe of the ashes, compelling the discovery; interiority is concrete in his trembling anticipation and quickened heart, revealing embodied emotion under pressure. However, internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, with emotions more performed than contradictory, slightly weakening the hierarchy of values at closure.

    Elias's motivation to uplift silent contributors is clear and rooted in his backstory, compelling his decision to approach Lira, with embodied emotion in his "pull in his chest" during the revelation; however, internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, and Lira's traits are more told than shown through contradictory impulses.

    Elias's motivation to prove strangers remember kindness is clear and intensifies through his methodical hopefulness, driving his actions with consistent traits like insomnia; interiority is concrete, embodied in his embrace of sleeplessness, revealing contradictory impulses in his quiet burning resolve. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, and his flaws complicate choices, leading to an earned endurance with felt cost of isolation. The backstory anchors present stance via the brush's acquisition, tilting his vigil without excess. The final renunciation of sleep forecloses rest with visible cost in his heavy yet alive eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to rescue dying arts is clear and rooted in her historical orientation, compelling her to lead the baking ritual that drives the climax; interiority is concrete through embodied actions like trembling hands, revealing contradictory impulses of fear and resolve. However, emotions sometimes lean toward poetic summary rather than raw embodiment, as in the "perfumed fear knotting her throat," which feels slightly stock. The final endurance forecloses scattering with felt communal cost, but secondary characters like Amir and Sira are underdeveloped, applying minimal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to reverse fate is clear and rooted in his inventive trait and family loss, intensifying through precise actions like unwinding the yoyo; interiority embodies contradictory thrill and despair effectively, as in his "bleak exhilaration" during discovery. The final renunciation wonders at illusion, earning stasis with felt cost, though some emotions lean toward summary labels like "unfulfilled longing."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in Elias's fear of abandonment, compelling confessions that intensify stakes, but interiority slips into diagnostic label-speak like "fear incarnate—his lifelong dread of abandonment," reducing embodiment; the final endurance feels earned with visible emotional cost in unbosoming secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prophet's motivation to transform threats into symphonies is clear and consistent, driving his actions from sensing the tide to composing; however, interiority relies on poetic abstractions like "restless stirring in his bones" rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. Traits like interpreting clouds are shown through choices, but emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments, such as when striking the xylophone. The final endurance feels earned with a conceptual cost of harmonizing chaos, but flaws remain label-like without deeper irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her quiet drive and leading to the forbidden shell-cracking with trembling hands, showing embodied emotion and contradictory impulses. Interiority is concrete, with actions aligning to reveal her under pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation of safety. Strength lies in the hierarchy of values visible when she blows the whistle, foreclosing her path with felt cost. Minor slip in occasional stock phrasing for emotions, but it doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation to rescue truth is clear and intensifies through emotional rationality, shown in embodied contradictions like heartache tempered by methodical planning; however, interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing, such as "heart ached with the weight," diluting specificity in the reflection on the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to unearth abandoned dreams is clear and intensifies through his actions, rooted in traits like stoic sensitivity that compel his rebellion via note-placing, but interiority often relies on abstract labels like "hushed blaze" rather than embodied contradictions. Emotions are somewhat embodied in physical chills and tears, yet contradictory impulses feel summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, as in the kneeling moment where resolve overrides cold without layered friction. The final renunciation of personal grief into eternal preservation earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost, visible in his tears pricking despite stoicism. Relationships and status dynamics are absent as it's single-POV with no other on-page characters.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation to trace her origins drives her actions, but her traits like "tranquilly perceptive" are label-heavy and not embodied in contradictory impulses during key moments, such as when she finds the volume. Internal conflict is summarized rather than shown through simultaneous impulses, leading to a tidy emotional progression without credible irrationality. The final readjustment of her self-image feels earned by causality but lacks a visible cost in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation to transform grief into origami cranes is clear and intensifies through his crafty actions, rooted in consistent traits like ingenuity, with embodied emotions shown in tears and murmurs; however, internal conflict feels more summarized than simultaneous in scene, slightly weakening contradictory impulses. The final renunciation earns fragile peace with visible cost in the lingering shadow, aligning actions with motives under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amir's motivation from the drone strike trauma is clear and intensifies to compel his obsessive hunt, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and pounding heart showing contradictory impulses in scene; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and his flaws complicate choices leading to an earned stasis in vowing renewal with felt cost of loss. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, lacking deeper irrationality under stress. The single-POV focus excels in revealing hierarchy of values through micro-choices like placing the geode.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation for Elara is clear and rooted in her war-fragmented home, intensifying to compel the decoding quest, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "eyes widening in that familiar, perpetual surprise" without embodied contradictions under pressure. The pilgrim's presence as a crucible forces choices, yet his role feels secondary and underdeveloped, lacking status dynamics that shift power. Emotions are declared rather than embodied, with the final gasp at the signal's wave trending toward therapy-speak without irrational layering. Perpetual surprise is labeled repeatedly but doesn't constrain micro-choices with visible cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation rooted in guilt over lying to his sister drives consistent interior conflict, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of illusions feels earned through prior reflections, foreclosing self-deception with a felt cost of carrying the truth. However, some interiority slips into stock regret phrasing, like "guilt gnawed at him," slightly diluting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to recycle mistakes into wisdom is clear and intensifies through reflective interiority, culminating in a resonant endurance with felt emotional cost. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in his hushed resolve amid lingering regret, embodied in tactile interactions like fingering the talisman. However, some stock phrasing in reflections, like "transforming regret into sharpened insight," borders on therapy-speak, slightly flattening specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to align heart and action is clear and intensifies through embodied regrets, compelling his final renunciation of the sea with visible emotional cost. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in scene, like hesitating at the kayak while humming melancholically, avoiding stock epiphanies. The single-POV interiority is concrete and particular, with flaws complicating choices without safety-hedging. The ending choice feels earned by prior causality, though a touch more embodied contradiction under stress could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong motivation from erased past compels choices toward empathy, with contradictory impulses in tunnel doubts; interiority is embodied but slips into stock labels like "hollow shell"; final regret earns change with visible cost at the lake.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to reforge the bond is clear and rooted in grief, intensifying through her reluctance to transform, with embodied emotions like trembling hands during the ritual showing contradictory impulses. However, internal conflict alternates in summaries rather than acting simultaneously in key scenes, and the metamorphosis feels more declared than dramatized with genuine struggle. The final hybrid form earns a meaningful change, but flaws like stock phrasing in her doubt ("doubt clung to her like dew on leaves") limit depth.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation for repentance is clear and rooted in her neglect of family, intensifying through the ritual to compel her final vow, with embodied emotions like tears mingling with the pool's silver. Interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in her embrace of confusion yet quest for clarity, though some stock phrasing like "chains of her neglect" borders on cliché. The meaningful change—finding forgiveness—feels earned by prior reflections, foreclosing solitary divinations with felt cost in the widening saucer crack. Flaws complicate choices authentically, avoiding tidy resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to integrate shadows for dimensional access is clear and rooted in pacifist traits, intensifying through confrontations with rage and isolation that compel her stitching choices. Interiority shows contradictory impulses, like suppressed anger emerging in visions, embodied in her holographic flickering and buoyant lifts. However, emotions occasionally lean into abstract labels like "ghostly resolve" without deeper contradictory embodiment under stress, slightly softening peak authenticity. The final integration earns a meaningful change with felt emotional cost, as seen in her joy-fueled weightlessness propelling the portal opening.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation as a destitute philanthropist is clear and intensifies through his actions, like releasing the bugs, revealing consistent traits under pressure; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in his straining arms during the rescue. However, the internal conflict feels summarized rather than shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the final realization borders on unearned epiphany. Mira, as a secondary character, applies relevant pressure but lacks depth in status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation for sparking a revolution is clear and rooted in her vigilant, calmly inventive traits, intensifying through her actions like using the quill holder to signal allies. Interiority is concrete, showing embodied emotion in her thrill amid darkness, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, relying on summary rather than scene-driven tension. The encounter with the sentinel reveals her values through micro-choices, like concealing the holder, with a felt cost of risk, but flaws feel more declarative than complicating choices deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand sacred patterns is clear and intensifies through her curse's visions, compelling her ritual choice with the cost of lost elusiveness. Interiority is concrete via embodied glimpses of futures haunting her like shadows, showing contradictory impulses in her hesitation. The final renunciation of fleeing fates is earned by the promise's pull, foreclosing her elusive path with visible anchoring on the bluff.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to map scars for poetic transcendence is clear and intensifies through internal contradictions like furious tranquility, embodied in his still exterior amid whirling rage; however, some interiority veers into abstract labels like "storm-kissed wonder" without deeper embodiment under pressure, slightly diluting the emotional progression at the climax where he refines verses.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to trade the needle card for philosophical maps is clear and intensifies through the duel, compelling high-stakes choices like activating his mechanical arm's blade. Interiority is concrete, with embodied contradictions in his "dignified chaos" during waiting and combat, revealing values through micro-choices like tracing the sundial. The flaw of somewhat stock philosopher traits is minor, as flaws complicate the climax without hedging. The duel moment, where he counters aggression with inquiry, most elevates the score by earning his endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to forge beauty from anarchy is clear and intensifies through his molt, rooted in consistent traits like shedding personalities, with embodied emotions shown in his itch and memories; interior conflict emerges in contradictory impulses during transformation, culminating in an earned renunciation of his weary wanderer self with felt cost of Jax's loss. Strengths include concrete interiority avoiding stock phrasing, as in the "familiar itch" triggering the molt. A minor slip is the somewhat diagnostic self-awareness in reciting verses, but it doesn't undermine the hierarchy of values revealed in scattering seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to mend his lost love through creative strategy is clear and intensifies via the clock and compasses, compelling his entry into the film; interiority is concrete in his steely longing embodied in piano playing, but some stock phrasing like "resolute ache" slightly flattens contradictory impulses. The final endurance in the arbor shows earned stasis with felt cost, as the stolen encore reconfigures his solitude without fully resolving it. Relationships are absent on-page, so no crucible pressure from secondary characters applies.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and intensifies through doubt, driving her to plant the seed and interpret dreams; internal conflict shows in contradictory impulses like fierce burning resolve against gnawing uncertainty. Emotions are somewhat embodied in actions like kneeling and reciting, but phrasing like "doubt luminous as the ridge's blossoms gnawed at her" trends abstract and stock. Final endurance of doubt as guiding force earns stasis with conceptual cost, visible in her descent amid thunder. Single-POV interiority is concrete but lacks deeper contradictory layering under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to confront unspoken regrets is clear and rooted in his bonsai tutor traits, with interiority showing embodied sorrow through deliberate actions like clipping twigs, but contradictory impulses are summarized rather than simultaneous in scene; the final spoken apology reveals values with felt emotional cost, though flaws feel somewhat abstracted without raw irrationality.


== Grader: Kimi K2 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s scientific remove is shown through concrete actions (kneeling, brushing dust), but her late softening is earned; the interior arc from detached observer to humbled caretaker is credible and embodied with minimal therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s adaptive trait shows in following frost patterns instead of grand gestures; the cost—accepting the family legacy and using smuggled charcoal to make new light—is legible at closure. Interiority is sensuous and embodied ("molten glass," "icy crust," "shattered remnants"), but the "discover purpose in the pauses" motivation is somewhat abstract, risking therapeutic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to “translate silence into music” is clear and intensifies, but interiority drifts toward poetic summary (“terror of the capsize…grief for lost shipmates”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final choice is earned, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s weary stubbornness is embodied in every soaked step and clenched grip on the lens; the interior contradiction—exhaustion vs. refusal to abandon the dead—drives each micro-choice. The moment he compresses himself into the impossible void to wrest the last spirit, the cost (body, breath, time) is palpable and earned. No stock phrases; the voice stays particular to a drowned caretaker. Only a slight drift toward abstract “rest” keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her embodied breathing arc mirrors the emotional excavation—but the “unused love” concept edges toward therapeutic abstraction rather than lived contradiction. The final release feels earned because the breathing pattern visibly alters her stance, yet the ancient-lover backstory is summarized more than dramatized, blunting the flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s obsession with “texture of time” is vivid and embodied in tactile design work; the retrocognitive trap forces a credible, costly renunciation of the fragment. Interiority is specific—hedge geometry as felt knowledge—but a few lines verge on abstract “reverie” labels rather than embodied contradiction, capping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation to safeguard the seeds despite physical restraint is consistent, embodied through micro-choices (wrist-shuffle, finger-cipher). Interiority lacks over-therapy yet roots in prior off-page history without more contradiction shown.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s obsession drives every beat; interiority is sensory-anchored, embodied, and specific. Motivation intensifies on-page: collecting absences then forging gives visible cost. The earned renunciation—listening to the shatter instead of denying it—closes the emotional arc cleanly. Synesthesia’s double edge (powerful tool / reopening wound) stays character-deep, untherapized.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “vault of forgotten arts” and “pang of doubt” ground her arc. Motivation (destiny’s door) intensifies through micro-choices: the floral cipher, the theft, the moonbeam release. The final renunciation of thievery is earned by the portrait’s revelation and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “quietly savvy” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his grief is embodied in the bookmark and the thawing ice—but the shift from frozen to warm heart is more asserted than dramatized; the final abandonment of pain feels slightly pre-emptive because the bookmark’s reprise is symbolic rather than forcing a new micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s phobias are embodied viscerally (open skyline pressing down, rusted shelves squeezing) and directly shape tactical choices—he climbs the shelf despite acrophobia to bait Mara. Interior contradictions (terror versus resolve) play out in real time, tying every beat to character, not label. A credible, earned endurance that explains the final reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract; the oracle’s “mild obsession” is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure, so the final sealing of the booklet feels inevitable rather than earned. Character remains a lyrical vessel more than a pressured agent.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eko’s quest for the origin of thought is lucid and thematically resonant, but interiority stays abstract—“sparks,” “convergence”—rather than embodied contradiction. The final insight is earned, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral; no sensor spike or motor tremor marks the price paid. Still, the composed stance remains consistent and individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guarded mistrust and quiet yearning for transparency are embodied in trembling fingers and the deliberate projection of his own doodle; the final shared gaze crystallizes a credible thaw with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is a brief “felt a pang” that edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet fire and pragmatic cunning are embodied in every micro-choice—feigned surrender, nightly poultices, marble rituals—so motivation stays legible and intensifies. The interior contradiction (deceiver turned healer) is dramatized, not labeled. Closure cost is felt: he wins the garden but remains branded low-luck, a social exile. Only the villagers’ off-stage scoffing keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“wild theory gnawing at her mind”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; Jax’s obliging warmth is consistent yet lacks a micro-choice that alters their status. The final shared laugh lands as earned stasis, though the cost feels generalized rather than sharply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is palpable—‘fingers itch for more than mere notes’—and the embodied need to crack the ghost’s code collides with the quiet, costly renunciation Elias accepts. The single POV remains coherent, and micro-choice (bowing discord instead of melody) directly reveals a hierarchy of values under waterlogged pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s swallowed-truth motive is vivid and embodied; the fever’s aftermath gives visceral stakes. Yet her interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“auroral sorrow of lost years”) that blurs contradictory impulse. Thorne remains a cipher—his “fault-tolerant” nature is asserted, not dramatized—so the relational crucible is thin. Final renunciation is earned, cost visible in the lighter exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Alex’s reckless streak and skepticism are embodied in his crunching boots and scoffing interiority; the swallowed-truth motive sharpens when the ghosts force him to appraise the valve wheel as a confession key. Yet the final turn—“washing away years of dust”—feels slightly abstract; the cost of forgiving his father is named more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s motive—observe without judgment—is stated early and reiterated, but interiority stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. His single micro-choice (unfolding the swan) is ritualized rather than pressured, so the cost feels ornamental. Still, the voice’s texture and embodied decay keep him distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s mellow, adaptive artistry feels intimate and specific; each micro-choice—humming softer when Finn’s shoulders knot—shows embodied interiority. Daughter-loss keepsake never lapses into easy sentimentalism; instead, it enacts the character’s hierarchy of values (wonder > safety). Passive vulnerability is balanced by deliberate nudging, so renunciation is earned, not forced.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s eccentricity is vivid—mismatched spectacles, book-cover coat—yet his interiority stays concrete: trembling fingers, quickened heart. The contradiction between despair and hope is embodied in the micro-choice to close the diary while feeling “the stirrings of something akin to hope,” a credible renunciation of despair with visible cost. Motivation intensifies from curiosity to world-repair, driving every sift of ash. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for anonymity yet driven to intervene—surface in the midnight cookie drops, but interiority drifts toward summary (“felt the pull of his old motivation”) rather than embodied tension. The final nod from islanders hints at earned relational shift, yet the cost of exposure feels under-dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority flickers but is mostly embodied in ritual gestures; the indigo palette and silence rituals are specific enough. The final renunciation—“assumptions fall”—earns its cost through visible fissures in the floor. Character flaw surfaces when he questions “why assume light is kind?” yet avoids messy contradiction; more contradictory impulse would lift this to top band.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is vivid—homesickness embodied in exhaustion, interior mapping via the shell, embodied emotions under cold—but the shift from aching nostalgia to conducting futures feels too smooth; a sharper internal fracture before the turn would crystallize growth.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her centuries of weary rebirth are embodied in the “periodically eternal” refrain—and her micro-choices (each procedural branch) visibly test competing values. The final forgiveness lands as earned because every timeline exposes the same core fear. Minor slip: the phrase “conquer the labyrinth of self” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection while deaf—drives every micro-choice; the moment he feels vibrations through the floor and adjusts the phonograph for Mira crystallizes his arc. The shared tapping on the drum shows embodied emotion without therapy-speak. Cost is visible: he trades isolation for the risk of reopening feeling. Secondary pressure from Mira is minimal but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—solitude vs. alliance—remains embodied and specific; the final renunciation of pursuit carries visible cost in the emptied tube and fading pigeon. Micro-choices (unfastening, refastening, whispering) reveal hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing; voice stays coherent. Only the “shadow” follower remains off-page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to open the vial yet fearing its grief—drives every beat; the final kneel and sob crystallize a credible renunciation of avoidance with visible cost. The aromatic caution trait is embodied (hesitant inhalations, trembling fingers), not labeled. Only minor slip: “wiser now” edges toward tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his playful ethics clash with his yearning to feel “time’s weave”—but motivation crystallizes in the rope ritual and the final vanishing. The contradictory impulses (summon vs refuse) act together in one beat, though the final choice’s cost is more lithe than crushing. No second on-page character means relationship pressure is absent, yet the solitary crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“acoustically perceptive,” “hummed faintly in his hands”), but the final vow feels slightly pre-articulated rather than wrested from contradiction; no opposing impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the cost reads as chosen rather than compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s fractured interiority under pressure is vivid and specific; each micro-choice (testing the petal, absorbing sparks) is causally linked to the final metamorphosis, turning her dealer persona into earned transcendence with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and consistent; the “cautious exuberance” shows in the micro-choice to pocket the envelope and the later offer to fund an exhibit. The friendship’s birth is credible, yet the grandfather backstory and Lira’s volunteer role are delivered in exposition rather than dramatized contradiction, muting the cost of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirah’s bold sympathy is embodied in concrete choices—offering reed talismans, pausing to comfort searchers—so the trait drives action. Interior contradiction surfaces only lightly; her loneliness is stated more than dramatized. The final grafting into community is earned by the shared search and the arbor she sculpts, carrying visible cost in obsidian shards gathered at peril. Still, the emotional layering could be sharper under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her illustrator’s eye colors every perception—but the contradictory impulses (preserve vs. risk the nap) are asserted more than dramatized in-scene. The final choice to borrow time from the giant’s dreams is credible, yet the cost (shortening the nap) is stated rather than embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief-driven quest is embodied in tactile ritual; the glass eyes function as both talisman and wound. Interior contradiction—hope versus empirical doubt—surfaces in the micro-choice to trace the mosaic rather than abandon it. The final smile is earned because the ritual’s cost (accepting an ambiguous answer) is dramatized, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between hiding and helping is dramatized in the pipe-chase micro-choice. His “kindly methodical” trait is shown, not told, in the gentle coaxing of the grate and the careful lift of the tape. The final visibility to the woman is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—his retreat foreshadowed. Secondary pressure is minimal, but the single on-page relationship is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s curiosity vs. visceral fear—plays out in embodied beats (tingling fingers, greening skin). The final surrender is earned by prior struggle and costs her human form, visible on the page. Minor slip: “circuitously sincere” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s insomnia, wry earnestness, and drive to “thresh meaning” are embodied in restless pacing, mud-smeared kneeling, and the trembling hand that offers the brooch; the final exchange with Mira crystallizes a shift from isolated grief to shared witness, foreclosing solitary art with visible cost—his mother’s lost heirloom leaves his possession forever.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s desire to magnify everyday magic is clear and embodied in her tactile handling of the pearl; the merging with unseen forces is dramatized through embodied sensation rather than summary. Interiority is specific—her clairvoyance flickers, she gasps, she stumbles—but the final stance crystallizes without a visible cost that forecloses a path, keeping it shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s reactive-vision trait is embodied in the brass-valve vision and her staggered revelations; the interior contradiction between archiving loss and forging future is dramatized through micro-choices (passing the valve, timing speeches). Cost is felt in her nightly solitary compiling. Minor slip: “reactively visionary” is label-adjacent once.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s compulsive mapping and inherited avoidance read clearly on the page; each tremor of certainty manifests in embodied micro-choices (tracing cracks with mapping habit, confessing before the punch). Yet interior contradictions resolve into acceptance so swiftly that the final stride into the fortress feels narrated rather than dramatized, nudging the score from excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s skeptical kindness is embodied in every micro-choice—her steady hands on the tile, the deliberate inhale before she risks belief—yet the interior contradiction between doubt and care is dramatized rather than labeled. The final renunciation of pure skepticism is earned by the causal chain of memory-transcription and carries a visible cost: Kai’s memories are now visitable but forever separate. Only the brother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is not tested; the score caps at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s boredom-to-desperation arc is embodied in pacing, clutching the fragment, and the micro-choice to coax rather than force the mutiny; the final “changed—boredom tempered by knowledge” shows earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“threadbare tapestry,” “hushed thunder in her chest”) yet occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“millennia like echoes”). The curse’s hold and her desire for after-goodbye create clear contradictory impulses acted out in the storm scene. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alex’s interior contradiction—honest child of a con artist—drives every beat; the ink pot and asylum math crystallize a credible renunciation of deceit with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“burning need,” “heart pounding”) stays specific, never diagnostic. The final micro-choice—closing the casket—earns the Earned Stasis by foreclosing further cons. Minor slip: “mathematics of a fair trade” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s custodial drive and tactile obsession are embodied in every micro-choice—charting the hum, refraining from grasping the textures—yet the interior contradiction between preservation and awakening remains more asserted than dramatized in scene. The final resolve to “awaken the world” is credible but arrives as summary rather than a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“colors bled into sounds”), but the survivor’s choices remain largely observational; the final ascent to the red container is a micro-choice yet lacks a felt cost that alters the path. Motivation to “discover the texture of memories” is stated repeatedly but never tested by a decision that risks or forecloses anything. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s gloomy cheerfulness is textural and embodied in humming beats, but interior monologue wobbles into thematic echo near the end; the change he presses on himself arrives too late to earn full causality leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lanara’s motives and dual allegiance are articulated with specificity, embodied in the graffiti code choices and the talisman ritual. Emotions are anchored in micro-decisions — she rubs the chip before spraying, bridges alliances with stories not slogans, and the final stance crystallizes without tidy resolution. A tangible cost (risk of eviction if discovered) is implied but never dramatized on page, holding her just short of highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—mixing chemicals, pacing gravel, steadying the camera—each tethered to the vanishing hush. The final endurance costs her warmth, solitude, and the grain itself, earning a credible renunciation. Interiority avoids label-speak; her dawnlit melancholy is shown in breath-catch and shutter-click. One slip: “dawnlit melancholy that weighed on her soul” edges toward diagnostic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured through tactile perception and quiet resolve; his motivation to “decode chaos into a path” is embodied in every micro-choice. The final clasp with Mira crystallizes a relationship shift under pressure. Minor deduction for a touch of label-speak (“heartfelt artisan” used twice).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s childhood map obsession is sketched but never tested; the “subtly confident” mask is stated more than embodied. Interiority is vivid (“worrying tranquility”) yet lacks contradictory impulse under pressure. The final step onto the ice is a credible renunciation with cost—he may freeze—but the choice feels inevitable rather than wrestled. Overall, a strong but not fully fleshed psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thorne’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority remains largely abstract—his “obsidian eyes” and “cryptic smiles” tell rather than embody. The single POV keeps focus, yet we never feel his struggle under pressure; patience reads as trait, not lived cost. No contradictory impulse surfaces in scene, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s desperation is vivid and embodied, but interior monologue slips toward diagnostic self-awareness (“override primal urges”) and an emotional telegraph beats that cost some specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is visceral—salt regret and copperlight doubt under the skin—and every step, from scuff-reading the door to brushing the lattice, is motive-driven. The father-legacy flaw is not told but acted upon; Elias confesses the bloodline lie through ritual rather than rumination and the renunciation feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “shadowed embers” eyes and the bead’s pulse in his palm anchor us—but the ghost bride’s choices remain off-stage; her “lovingly venomous” guidance never forces a micro-choice from Elias that visibly costs him until the final beat. The debt’s emotional weight is felt, yet the bride’s agency is spectral summary rather than embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—aching for ruin yet buoyed by “eerie faith”—is embodied in her tranced stitching; the cost is the irreversible surrender of waking agency each night. Motivation stays rooted in lineage and place, but the sleepwalking device externalizes her flaw so cleanly that the final “threads in her hands” feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for faith yet fearing the orchard’s snare—surface in tactile micro-choices (touching a root-wrapped ribcage, pausing at shifting shadows). The final Earned Stasis—her quietly restored faith amid bones—carries visible cost in the time and bodily effort of excavation. Interiority is specific, though a few stock phrases (“warmly curious spark”) dilute voice. No second character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing for “meaning in the margins” is clear and embodied in her chalk-transcription micro-choices; the final pocketing of borrowed chalk crystallizes a quiet but credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“simple yet profound”) edge toward label-speak. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Overall, a well-sketched single POV whose flaw (nostalgic over-attachment) complicates the dawn’s close.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her feigned giggle, the spark from the eternal flame lighting her needle—but the contradiction between wisdom and disguise is asserted more than dramatized; no single beat forces her to pay a visible price for the mask, so the final renunciation feels slightly pre-paid rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s fierce tenderness and cryptic medium identity are embodied through her micro-choices—tracing condensation, pressing the shard, whispering to spirits. The interior contradiction (seeking apology yet fearing vulnerability) is present but summarized more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of cryptic solitude is earned by the shard’s healing cost and the spirits’ choral pressure. Voice remains consistent, though “cryptic” is asserted rather than revealed through speech patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s layered interiority—translator’s hyper-awareness, anesthetic wooziness, shrewd-calm mask—plays across every beat. Her micro-choices (approach the boy, offer the coral, trace the cast) escalate congruently with motivation and theme. Amir’s wary press mirrors her trauma, creating a crucible for shared vulnerability. The handing-off of the coral at the end forecloses a path for both with tangible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. isolation) are dramatized through the fresco fragment and light-painting. The final renunciation—choosing to feed the network rather than hoard the joy—carries visible cost (“feeding back into it”). Minor slip: “pensive mirth” is asserted more than enacted in body.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “methodically playful” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the nickel, tapping blossoms) and drives her escalating experiments; the final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost in the loss of her restorer’s sure footing. Interiority stays vivid and specific, though the visitor remains a cipher and thus relationship pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s defiance is vivid and embodied in every gesture, but the interior contradiction—his roguish charm versus the terror of mind-tax—is only asserted, not dramatized in micro-choice. The final shake of the gourd feels earned by prior stakes, yet the cost (his exposure, the club’s dispersion) is summarized rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s insomnia and longing are vivid, but centuries of stasis flatten interior contradiction; the final reunion feels gifted rather than earned by micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation to “preserve the sound of forgotten names” is clear and embodied in her micro-choice to risk the Heart of Names. The foxglove regret is palpable, yet the interior contradiction (duty vs. personal loss) is stated more than dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied, tense micro-choices around the ink-well anchor her contradictions; the risk and care both show up in how she steadies her hand yet presses the quill too far. Silence-as-shield is dramatized through the symphony’s playback to Thorne, a real-time cost paid on the page. The final embrace retains ambiguity rather than tidy redemption, a restrained but credible earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory miner/storyteller heritage is embodied in micro-choices—scraping adhesive, calibrating chain links—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“his hands shaking”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation of force for “clever, compassionate engineering” is earned and carries visible cost in the trembling gate.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief is vividly embodied (curled “like dried petals”), his interior contradiction (preserve vs. wither) is active in every beat, and the final micro-choice—releasing the raw-truth message—rings from prior build. Still, his shift toward “sharing not hiding” is articulated rather than enacted; the cost reads as declared rather than lived on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile reading of wood grain and the pilot logbook feels character-specific—but the “featherly determined” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a costly choice. The final renunciation (accepting loss as necessary distance) is earned by the preceding pattern work, yet the emotional cost is more stated than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.4)
    Elara’s interiority glides over logical steps—magic feather is clutched and instantly trusted, no inner conflict. Clear motivation “yearning to belong” is stated, yet never expressed via a concrete scene-level choice with visible trade-off. Endurance/renunciation never earns visible cost because the beat is summary, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—wonder vs. sorrow—stays embodied in the glass and seeds, but the “cheerful gloom” label is repeated instead of freshly enacted; no micro-choice after the first seed reading means the final insight feels inherited rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—serenading monotony with creativity—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (placing the bishop, tipping the guitarist) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is mostly embodied, though phrases like “analytical mind firing” edge toward label-speak. The final image of Elias pocketing the bishop and “plotting the next wonder” crystallizes his stance without a felt cost, so the change is more thematic than personal. Mira’s presence is functional but thin; she serves the orchestration rather than complicating Elias’s interior.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—fleeing memory yet inscribing it—play out in the ritual. The final fusion with the garden is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “cosmic verse” is slightly abstract, not fully embodied until the blood-ink moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's interiority is textured and embodied (“his breath steady despite the chill”), his motive-to-see-value seeds early, and the final rip-to-insight shows credible endurance/renunciation. Minor slips: passive voice phrases and a few stock metaphors keep it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s contradictory impulses—protective duty vs. the need to confess—surface in the tactile handling of the box and the choice to stop and share it. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids therapy-speak. The final beat of “lighter now, its burden shared” earns a credible renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s lucid-watchfulness and logical-dreaming are dramatized through embodied choices (balloon launches, mandala edits) that escalate hope-altitude; the final renunciation of another timeline feels earned with visible conceptual cost. Interiority remains coherent and character-specific without therapy-speak. Micro-drift: some phrases drift toward abstract labels (“fractures in a world weary…”) rather than concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty to map versus need to unburden—are dramatized in the squeeze through ivy and the trembling recovery of diaries; the final vow rewrites legacy as shared narrative with visible cost of solitude intact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “borrowed heartbeat” is stated more than embodied. No contradictory impulses in-scene; choices feel pre-ordained. The final fade-into-mirage is poetic yet cost is only asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s haunted motivation is palpable, but interiority slips into abstract self-diagnosis (“understanding its price would be steep”) rather than embodied cost; the final renunciation is underwritten because we feel the drain yet not Elara’s visceral regret.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—greed vs. reverence—are embodied in the micro-choice to turn the valve; the cost (empire collapse, exposure) is felt on the page. Sentiment is dramatized through tactile handling of the egg and whispered promise, not label. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific. Flaws complicate the final act; the renunciation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior tug-of-war—purity as defiance—charges every micro-choice; her bodily grace in the sanctuary threads motivation to action without slip. Motivation crests in the wordless resolve at “between sigh and smile,” earning renunciation cost. Interiority is specific, not label-heavy. Character flaw complicates goal and forces visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—elegant manipulator vs. would-be truth-teller—drives every beat; the moment he threads the puppet-self to the stick crystallizes the cost of his reversal. Lena’s absence is felt as pressure, not device. The serene mask never slips, yet the embodied tremor in his ink-stained fingers shows the strain. One more dramatized micro-choice under fire would have lifted this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—his urge to orchestrate versus the grotto’s demand to witness—plays out in embodied micro-choices (gathering vines, knotting the wing, releasing the arch). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he lets the structure sway, surrendering authorship. Flaws (hubris of curation) complicate the choice and remain unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara's guilt-to-resolve arc shows embodied emotion and specific micro-choices (threading rope to card holes); the internal thaw feels earned, though "technically gentle" remains largely asserted through craft rather than enacted conflict on page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory gift (foresight via hindsight) is embodied in her micro-choice to close her eyes and dream on the cold floor; the final smile shows earned change. Interiority is vivid (“regret into reluctant prophecy”) and embodied emotion under pressure (“heart raced”). Motivation stays rooted in the quest, but the interior contradiction could be sharper mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s frugality and ironic devotion are embodied in concrete micro-choices—rationing candles, scavenging charcoal—while the interior conflict between empirical science and occult hunger is dramatized in the moment he offers his “frugal vigilance” to the spectral sages. The final covenant is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the tile is now inert, his path sealed. Yet the ghostly sages remain external agents; no second on-page character pressures him, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s pacifist scheming is embodied in micro-gestures and the silent choreography of the pin; Thorne’s cellular release is credible, but the shift from toxin to grace feels slightly compressed, muting the full cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—grounded craftsman vs. dream-chaser—drives every beat; the embodied grief for his wife charges the final choice with visible cost. Micro-choices (incorporating sextant shards, syncing breath) reveal a hierarchy of values. The flaw of over-precision collides with longing, producing the earned stasis of forever housing the dream. No slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory grief-driven persistence and Lila’s anxious witness create a crucible; the quartz eyes and ribbon crystallize interior stakes. Motivation to “bridge generational wisdom” is dramatized through the mid-air retrieval of the notebook and the accidental quartz-fusion of the ribbon—visible cost on the page. Interiority stays embodied (slippery bark, swinging bag) without therapy-speak. Only the late reveal of the notebook feels slightly convenient, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s bewilderment and thirst for forbidden knowledge are palpable, but interiority drifts into abstract exposition (“gnawing motivation,” “philosophical breakthroughs”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final resolve is signaled more than dramatized; we feel the shift but not its visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through micro-choices (cross-referencing diary, negotiating with guardian), but interiority remains abstract—no embodied emotion or visible flaw. Thorne’s desperation is declared rather than dramatized. Final renunciation of silence is earned yet cost feels intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s chimeric identity and longing for wholeness are vivid, embodied, and drive every beat; the twin’s voice emerges through sensory memory rather than exposition. Interior contradictions—joy in abnormality against ache for reunion—play out in real time beneath the big top. The final step off the ship feels earned because the narrative threads dramatize the cost of integration. Minor slip: “blissfully aberrant” is asserted more than enacted in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s warmly methodical interiority is concrete and character-specific, guiding each micro-choice under accumulating pressure; her final act of merging absence with presence is credibly rooted in the obsessive clarity motive.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s endurance-driven motive (forged repose) is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—traced cracks, stone placement—and escalates to an earned, costly stance crystallization at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “thistle-blown hope” and bleeding hands embody motive—but the retrocognitive gift is asserted more than tested; no moment shows its limits or cost under pressure, so the final choice feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“preemptively nostalgic, aching for the vibrancy of shared histories”), but the archivist’s choices remain largely observational; the final inscription is more summative than a decisive, costly act that reconfigures identity. Motivation is clear, yet the micro-choice that would crystallize her new self feels under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—playful chant against creeping despair—is embodied in sensory detail and micro-choices (spinning the rag, brushing vines). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: extinguishing the flame, pocketing the rag, and stepping lighter. The chant evolves from shield to genuine levity, showing earned change. Flaws (creative burnout) complicate choices and are not tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied; his contradictory impulses—quiet chronicler vs. active seer—surface in the cicada’s placement. Elara’s fear is shown through breath and finger-twist, not labels. The final hand-off of the cicada crystallizes a cost for both: Elara must leave, Kael must let her, and the moment is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and dream of “flavors of silence” are vivid and embodied; the porcelain doll’s hush is felt in her body. Micro-choices—whispering fears, cupping the doll, sealing silences—track her shifting stakes. The final sip of essences shows earned change with visible cost: her phobia “sprouting into resilient openness.” Interiority stays concrete, though the father remains off-page, limiting relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—teaching silence while still haunted by his own loss—surfaces in micro-choices (pole rhythm, pauses, vial demonstration). Mira’s shift from frantic chatter to whispered thanks is embodied in breath and posture, not labels. The cost is felt: Elias relinquishes his own protective hush to offer it to her. Minor slip: Mira’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her pulse-accelerated climb, but interior contradiction is thin; the “wisely adventurous” trait is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choice at the mural peeling is sharp, yet the cost of claiming the throne feels abstract rather than personally scarring. The final merge is earned, but the emotional price is generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “tender shadow keeper” role shows in how she strokes shadows like skittish creatures. The contradictory impulse to both sever and heal is dramatized when she presses her scarred palm to Lorin’s, guiding release while risking re-entanglement. The final renunciation (letting the threshold vanish) carries visible cost: Lorin’s departure and the sanctuary’s renewed isolation. Minor slip: “loaded emptiness” recurs as label-speak without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—playful rule-bending vs. genuine altruism—surface in the “accidental” spore spills and the dive itself, driving every beat. Her embodied reaction to pressure (“translate this into diamonds”) anchors motive in body and memory. The final act of sharing diamonds crystallizes a credible change with visible cost. Minor slip: the leap from glitchy plea to full commitment feels slightly under-motivated mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart pounding,” “vibrations hummed through his bones”), and his renunciation is foreshadowed by the father’s hidden crank. The final pocketing of the handle crystallizes a credible, costly stance. Minor: the “dynasty ender” label is repeated rather than dramatized in the present beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elandor’s withdrawn solitude and buried craving to “capture possibility” are cleanly embodied; the final unsnapping of the gauntlet is grounded in prior longing. Interiority is specific to him—no stock templates—but several pulses of “shivering bliss” edge into label-speak and dilute contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s wounded archivist persona is crisp—dust under fingernails, divorce ache shaping every micro-choice. Interiority oscillates between archival precision and raw grief in embodied beats: the tremor before touching Josiah’s folder is the mirror of the tremor before opening her ex-husband’s note. Tactful hope not asserted but lived out in the slow unfolding, earning a credible shift from refuge-seeker to active mender; cost is felt in the moment she replaces the folder, brushing away the dust anew.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart pounding,” “clutched the only relic”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final reappearance feels earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation—“to hush a prophecy”—is vivid and unwavering, intensifying until the final invested silence. Interiority remains embodied, e.g., “dew lingered on his soul,” and the contradiction between his boyhood memory and adult solitude sharpens the choice. The earned renunciation at climax (vested hush swallowing all prophecy) carries tangible emotional cost, foreclosing an alternate version of the world. Slight under-complication in status dynamics (solitary figure, no dialogue) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s orderly seed-sorter persona, initial quiet precision, and decisive pivot toward leaf-reading form a believable arc with embodied internal conflict. The moment she “pokes” the moonstone dust into the monument crystallizes her values and re-defines her agency, foreclosing her purely methodical path with a playful, felt cost. Quiet but earned Earned Renunciation/Resonation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—precision vs surrender to chaos—is embodied in micro-choices (tying the compass to a pendulum, reading leaf vortices) and culminates in a visible cost: abandoning his lifetime blueprints. The flaw (obsessive control) actively complicates the crossing and is confronted, not merely noted. Backstory is brief, anchored in present action, and tilts his stance. Voice remains particular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—equilibrium versus luminous regret—is embodied in the coin’s weight and the forge’s heat; his micro-choice to heat with Virgo alignment rather than coal shows motive in action. Aurora’s naming failure is recalled with felt cost, and the final re-naming crystallizes a new stance. The flaw of hubris is confronted, not excused, and the cost (accepting the golden seams of failure) is visible in the redeemed figure’s glow. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“modestly fearless” shows in her steady candle-flame courage and the micro-choice to coax laughter rather than command. The contradictory impulse to heal through joy while wielding a deliberately warped harp is dramatized in scene. Closure cost is felt: her own heart “echoes with modest triumph,” acknowledging the toll of repeated soul-work. Minor slip: “luminous ache” recurs as label-speak twice, blunting edge.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—survival guilt vs. need to forgive—are embodied in spasms and angle-mapped posture; the final forgiveness formula is earned through these visceral costs. Interiority stays concrete, but the “mathematics of mercy” epiphany edges toward tidy equation, blunting flaw complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“weight lift,” “warm in her hand”), but the childhood backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that never loops back to alter her tactics; the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than freshly compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s ghost-sight and childhood trauma anchor motivation, but interiority drifts into summary (“he knew better”) rather than embodied contradiction. His final winding of the barrel is a decisive micro-choice that costs him solitude, yet the shift feels slightly neat given the prior weightless exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's loss-motive is palpable—“compress eternity into a moment to reclaim the lost echo”—and the bottled whisper functions as an embodied micro-choice with tangible price. Interior contradiction holds: he longs for perfect reunion while destabilizing the very permanence he craves. Only minor over-diagnosis in the line “the fragility of all things” registers as lightly therapeutic rather than embodied under pressure; it softens without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary nostalgia vs. present scavenger—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (covering mirrors, clutching shard). The final renunciation of active rebellion for elegiac reimagination is earned and carries visible cost: “a fragile victory amid the stars.” Interiority stays concrete, though occasional lyric summary edges toward performed sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is driven by a motive to reclaim the light stolen by midnight. Internal conflict is clear (the betrayal of the mentor still haunts him), but contradictions between optimism and doubt play only in summary before the climatic sing—never in an explicit choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her vials clink, the compass thrums, the lagoon’s water embraces—yet the “sensibly eccentric” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation of mundane life is earned and carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “hands dancing with the gnarled remnants” and turbine-hum heartbeat anchor her embodied emotion. The contradiction between her drive to simplify and the storm’s chaos is dramatized when she chooses to sculpt under the archway, paying the cost of exposure and time. Motivation remains consistent, but the final renunciation (leaving the slide for future work) is slightly under-costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “quietly driven” trait is dramatized through nightly postcard study and dawn pilgrimages to the cathedral window. The lineage of loss is credible, and her final mural choice carries visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase “reckon with it all” edges toward label-speak in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s solemnity and archival drive are clear, but interiority drifts into summary (“his heart ached”) rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive embodiment is vivid yet the transition back to the zeppelin feels abrupt, lessening the felt cost of his vow. Micro-choices (arranging shells) show hierarchy of values, yet the final beat lacks a visible renunciation or new limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for reunion yet rejecting the bottle—remains embodied and specific; the final renunciation carries visible cost as he trades illusion for arduous labor. Motivation intensifies from skepticism to civic duty, but the “entire civilization” scale feels abstract for 800 words. Micro-choices (hurling the bottle, lighting the first lantern) align with motives. Still, secondary characters appear only as returning silhouettes, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fear of obsolescence pulses through the wax-shaving ritual—but the final beat of “purpose reaffirmed” is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the cost of his accidental prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s desire to “touch borrowed time” is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“furiously tranquil pulse”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The seed-saver identity is stated, never weaponized in a micro-choice; the acorn-cap placement feels inherited, not personally urgent. Still, her embodied tremor under cold and the final smile give us credible emotional progression with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s credibly curious humility is embodied in silent chart-checks, frayed wiring repair, and the decisive refusal to ring the bell; the slight reserve stems from reflection lines that tilt present choice but stay just below the 20 % ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—flight vs. communion—surface in micro-choices (tracing the star, pausing the sweep). The final renunciation of pure hiding is earned by prior empathic tracing and carries visible cost in her tear-streaked stillness. Minor slip: “spiritually curious” is once label-speak before it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias functions consistently as both observer and actor whose final guardianship of the box crystallizes stakes; his astonishment is embodied, not token. Static conflicts and beat overlap cap the grade shy of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the urn fragment, the pulse she feels—but her contradictory impulses (to hoard vs. share borrowed time) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final “mended capsule” gesture is earned, yet the cost is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s gentle ethos and “beauty in the incomplete” motive drive every choice, culminating in the feather-rescue beat. Micro-choices (kneeling, verses, slotting the feather) reveal hierarchy of values with felt cost. Quiet endurance earns credible closure, but interiority slips toward lyric summary under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—his “brazen calm” is embodied in steady hands and unhurried wire twists—but the illness remains abstract, never degrading thought or action. The diary functions as an extension of motive, yet the sentient stones and plants are asserted more than dramatized, blurring the cost of his final serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s skeptical stance and quest for “homecoming chemistry” are clear and embodied; her glow and reluctance show contradiction. The micro-choice to quicken her pace at the footprints signals rising stakes. Yet the final beat is more epiphany than action—cost is felt but not dramatized in a fresh micro-choice, keeping her just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s quiet ember of motive is embodied in every gesture—crushing pods, murmuring extinct tongues—yet interior contradiction is muted; no moment shows him doubting the cost of awakening the concord, so the arc feels more ritual than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s ache for her brother and Tracker’s loyalty are embodied and consistent; the micro-choice to trace the cylinder grooves under lantern light crystallizes their shared stake. Interiority stays concrete, but the final step onto the cracked horizon is slightly under-motivated—no explicit cost or renunciation is dramatized, only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s temporal gift and pariah status are embodied through her tactile handling of the compass and the deliberate slowness of her sketching; the micro-choice to align the applique with the viewport crystallizes her shift from exile to explorer. Internal contradiction is light—more wistful than conflicted—so the arc feels inevitable rather than fiercely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elarion’s motives (restore honor, playful reverence) are clear and embodied in each swap; the interior contradiction between “chivalrous” and “thief” is named but not dramatized in a micro-choice under pressure. The final bow and escape show earned change, yet the Archmage’s off-stage thaw feels like external absolution rather than a cost Elarion pays.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Alex’s motive to chronicle “small gestures” is embodied in the pawnless chessboard and the meticulous footfalls; each step exposes previous trauma and present benevolent ruthlessness. The internal contradiction—kind intent vs merciless pursuit—drives the arc without collapsing into summary. Final renunciation of the penumbra carries felt cost: Alex loses the comfort of eclipse and inherits the burden of record.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“liquid silver of her visions,” “stabbed like hidden thunder”), and her micro-choice to trace the feather against the stone is character-specific. The buried-talent conflict is dramatized rather than summarized, and the final renunciation of nightly substitution carries visible cost. However, the childhood-village flashback is delivered in a single expository block rather than through present-tense beats, slightly blurring the causality of her pain.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's self-loathing surfaces through embodied contradictions (fierce repose vs ticking maze), but interior swings from guilt to absolution come dangerously close to therapeutic self-analysis; passivity in mid-scene could cost immersion yet micro-choices at the tapestry bench rescue legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. artistic defiance—are embodied in her poetry sessions; the final renunciation of innocence is earned and costs her mischievous freedom. Interiority is vivid, though “price of forgiveness” is slightly abstract. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interiority is vivid—burning lungs, trembling hand, kintsugi resolve—yet the “uncertain” label is asserted more than dramatized; his doubt surfaces only in summary. The final quilting of memory into the statue earns credible change, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—nostalgia vs. release—is embodied in the seashell ritual; the micro-choice to place it by the spring crystallizes his arc. The “intimately aloof” trait constrains the moment: he speaks the vow alone, cost visible in tears. Flaw: the decades-old promise is asserted more than dramatized, muting motivational force.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his grief and conviction embodied in the cork’s warmth—but the reunion beat is too sudden; Mira’s survival and arrival feel externally granted rather than earned by Elias’s agency, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—"stitched heart ached with raw solace"—and motives (charting loss, self-repair) drive every beat. Micro-choices (spinning the dial, hammering gears) reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: the navigator accepts perpetual fragmentation to guide others. Minor slip: backstory paragraph is slightly summary-heavy, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s compulsive honesty drives micro-moves and costs (truth slips as she speaks the ritual). Interiority is visceral but stays a step below embodiment, e.g., “glass eye cool and unyielding.” The occlusion choice is earned—foreclosing the path of shared pain—but emotional layering feels one-note in the final image, lacking contradictory emotion at payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s layered interiority—“conversed with gulls” and jars of echoes—grounds his eccentricity in lived ritual, while the Edelweiss-dictated decision to shoulder another’s sorrow visibly costs his accustomed solitude and alters his trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s contradictory pull between empirical rigor & hope animates every movement; the embodied loneliness is credible and deepened by micro-choice (polishing chip with sleeve, abandoning map). Clara remains off-page yet felt in every beat until the final renunciation releases him with explicit cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her disenchantment embodied in the heat of the ember grotto and the slip of Lir’s hand—but the final choice to dip her fingers feels slightly under-motivated; the “softly commanding” trait is asserted more than dramatized in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between scientific detachment and romantic urgency is dramatized in her micro-choice to crush the nautilus shell. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost—she returns altered, risking the friendship. Minor slip: “scientifically romantic” is asserted more than enacted in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—"feral nostalgia gnawing at my edges"—but the jealousy of past selves is summarized rather than dramatized in real time, blunting the emotional cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief and new vocation cohere throughout; her disclosure of losing her sense of smell changes Mira’s stance on inheritance. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tug between the wound that keeps her isolated and the urge to repair others—both visible on her steady-screw micro-choice. No relationship crucible is needed because only one character acts.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly discipline vs. inherited curse—drives every micro-choice; the crystallizing skin is embodied, not labeled, and the final rune-scars carry visible cost. Motivation (“transform scars into stories”) is present from the first paragraph and intensifies through the ritual. Minor slip: the superstition method feels slightly under-motivated in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—gossip-column power vs. sisterly remorse—are embodied in the perfume ritual and the harpsichord choice. The final apology carries visible cost: Lila’s partial forgiveness and Elara’s scarred heart. Interiority is specific, though “imperfect miracles” drifts toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Witness’s motivation is stated but never tested; he moves through the library without interior contradiction or embodied cost. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—only serene procession toward inevitable success. The “eternal vigil” backstory is summarized, not dramatized, so the final unification feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his squinting, the chill, the key’s weight—but the final epiphany (“clocks measured the soul’s horizon”) arrives as a summary rather than a dramatized contradiction. The mantle-clock-key heirloom and the reversed water flow anchor his micro-choices, yet the cost of his new understanding is asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to grief while mapping release—drives every micro-choice; the final recalibration of the barriers is earned by her prior spatial gift and the embodied cost of naming Kai. The “quiet wildfire” metaphor risks label-speak but is immediately grounded in her pulse and breath under blue light.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction—“calculations vs father’s chaos”—drives every micro-choice, culminating at lantern. Embodied emotion (hands pounded, pocketed sliver) balances risk & restraint convincingly. Final renunciation carries cost felt by Elara and reader. No amnesia, no tidy epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—curator of endings who secretly longs for connection—remains embodied in micro-choices (rerouting calls, rubbing the disc). The final self-loop confession is earned by prior isolation and costs him his underground refuge. Motivation is clear, consistent, and intensifies to the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief-driven ritual is credibly embodied; the micro-choice to steep the locket in ink crystallizes his arc. Interiority is concrete (“haunted euphoria building in his chest”), but the covenant’s regeneration feels slightly abstract, blurring cost. Still, the final beat—tucking the locket against his heart—earns a credible renunciation of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s jocular mask and root loneliness are embodied in the pun he cracks on arrival; the moon-rock chain of reciprocity forces him to trade story for story, so his isolation fractures with visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the final smile lands as earned stasis. Secondary characters remain sketches that serve the communal beat rather than pressure Elias individually.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—his grief is felt in the “stormy sea” metaphor and the “quiet blaze.” The skin-language trait is dramatized through tactile beats that alter tactics. Closure is earned: grief is re-mapped into acceptance via the stillpoint, with visible cost (the ring cooling, the forest’s farewell). Minor slip: “uncharted emotional depths” flirts with diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “confidently uncertain” stance is embodied in her micro-choices—tuning receivers, clutching the pen, broadcasting confessions—so motive stays legible under pressure. The interior contradiction (doubt + action) drives the climax, and the cost (crew gone, anomaly altered) is felt. Minor drift: the AI companion is introduced retroactively, blurring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence yet yearning for music—are embodied in trembling hands and hesitant humming; the final choice to map silence into melody is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the camera’s empty chamber now a vessel). Thorne’s quietly charismatic presence applies pressure without overt antagonism, shifting status through sign-language exchanges. Minor slip: Thorne’s interiority is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s guilt vs guardian’s love—are embodied in trembling fingers and volcanic sobs; the final sketching beat crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Motivation stays rooted in Mira’s deathbed promise, intensifying through each artistic breadcrumb. Interiority is specific (“analytically intuitive” mind as forge) and avoids label-speak. Only the off-stage Mira keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (rebellion vs. longing) act simultaneously in scene, embodied in the drumming. The final “wondered if it was truly him” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “auroral sorrow” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied drumming compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s gait-reading gift and whisper-philosophy are concrete and embodied; the coin-flip micro-choices show interior hierarchy under pressure. Marcus’s heavy tread and exhausted trudge crystallize status collapse. The final “subtlety endures” lands as earned renunciation with visible social cost. Minor: Marcus’s interior remains generic, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s half-spoken secret and the guardian’s wordless instruction create credible interior stakes; the final whispered confession is earned by the preceding spiral of light. The guardian’s “spiralingly calm” presence is consistent yet slightly archetypal, lacking a unique flaw or contradiction that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his gift of hearing unspoken words is embodied in the orb’s pulse and the grotto’s magnetic tug. Motivation (“plant forests of second thoughts”) drives every micro-choice, from whispering instructions to cradling the orb tighter. The final smile carries earned cost: the orb dims, energy spent, rebellion seeded. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s longing, contradictory impulses toward Marek vs. the call of the sea, and scrimshaw-propelled micro-choices are vivid and embodied. Final transformation lands with earned, visible cost when Marek is left on the dock clutching her story. Could tighten the merfolk legacy reflection to deepen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—reporting neighbors yet secretly aiding them—are dramatized through the whittling ritual and the bouquet exchange; the blank mask and theatrical narration externalize the split while the final “cultivated lightness” lands as earned endurance with visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s aesthetically driven trait is embodied in every beat—his tactile tracing of quartz, the deliberate paraphrasing, the final whispered verse—so motivation stays vivid. Interior contradiction is present: awe versus fear of the colonnade. The Earned Stasis (renunciation of conquest for communion) is fully earned and carries visible cost: the atrium’s boundaries dissolve, leaving him forever changed. Minor slip: “tremor of certainty” is labeled more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for color yet recoiling from its garish truth—drives every beat; the final renunciation of restored sight is earned by the visceral horror of “garish clashes” and costs him the very beauty he sought. Micro-choices (fern placement, reed surrender) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Flawed perception remains consistent, never explained away. Only the “innocently cunning” label drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “powerfully gentle” touch and quiet motivation anchor every beat. The contradiction between her yearning for connection and her engineered, solitary quest is embodied in the cracked lens and the glider’s slowing return. Cost is felt: the cracked lens and the final “humming softly” bell show irreversible change. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in the locket and stencil, but his interiority drifts into summary (“subdued ardor,” “quiet mission”) rather than contradictory impulse. Lira’s arrival supplies pressure, yet her choice to accept the tattoo feels externally prompted, not wrestled from her own fracture. The final cost—Elias’s continued solitude—is visible but not dramatized as a fresh wound.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and inherited duty are clear, but her interiority stays abstract; Marcus’s guilt is embodied yet his shift to confession feels externally prompted rather than internally compelled. The measuring-tape inheritance adds lineage texture, yet Elara’s decisive act—charting multiplied paths—reads more as ritual demonstration than costly choice. No visible price is exacted from her at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the historian’s contradictory impulses—ecstasy and torment—co-exist in the same beats. Motivation to “pursue forbidden knowledge” is dramatized through the steadily unpredictable dance and the final collapse. The earned cost—loss of personal innocence—lands cleanly. Minor slip: the phrase “anguished joy” is repeated enough to edge toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the river-stone grounding and “luminous regret” register in body and choice. The final binding of her own freed shadow carries visible cost—she is “forever changed”—but the causality of that cost is slightly smoothed by summary rather than dramatized contradiction, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “raw” state after betrayal is shown through tactile acts like peeling forged permits. The chameleon tail as mirror is earned, not asserted. Motivation (balance compassion with self-respect) drives every micro-choice, culminating in the dawn smile that costs him naïveté. Minor slip: “diagnostic label-speak” in “reconstruct his shattered sense of purpose” could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s need to read scars is lucid, but her interior loops on closure-seeking vs wound-re-opening feel paraphrased rather than dramatised (“seeking closure often meant reliving the pain”). Tears alone do not fully embody the contradiction on the page; contradiction needs live micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath caught in the tone of hushed thunder”), but the arc leans on psychometric exposition rather than active contradiction; the final choice to “release” unused love is more stated than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s arc is internal and lyric, but her concrete micro-choice—plotting each falling star—grounds motive; yet the emotional cost of this renewal is felt more as tone than embodied consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s dreamless vigilance and quiet resolve are embodied in every step; the insomnia is never labeled but shown through his unblinking patrol and the way he “perceives fractures in reality.” The final act of charming the archive is earned by this trait, and the cost—an endless, solitary vigil—is felt in the closing image of the ticking clock in his pack.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive to “rediscover the wild frontier of his mind” is stated early and steadily intensifies; each grove visit tightens the internal stakes. Interiority is concrete—gear pressed to temple, wind notes vibrating through bone—without therapy-speak. The final laughter/tears moment earns the change: the frontier is regained at the cost of the gear’s silence and his prior certainties. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “leash of doubt” and “unused courage” are named rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses play out in real time; choices feel pre-ordained by theme. The guides serve as oracles, not crucibles, so relationship pressure is absent. Earned change is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s conflict between paralysis and the yearning to break silence is embodied throughout voice, gesture, and pacing. Interiority pulses in his regeneration tingles and the warm bolt in his pocket, turning guilt to tactile present. The micro-choice to stay—made at dawn with cost explicitly felt—renders contradiction at full scale.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elowen’s miniature-titan presence drives every move: her regally unpretentious restraint shapes tactics, incites interior contradiction, and lends credible weight to subtle choices that re-thread the deception web. Flaws and power coexist without over-articulated self-analysis, producing an earned renunciation rather than a tidy triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s grief-soaked vigil is viscerally embodied in the tapping habit and the frayed atlas page; the interior contradiction between scientific duty and filial betrayal is alive in every drum of her fingers. The moment she recognizes her father’s Morse-coded confession, her prior stoicism cracks with credible cost—tears mix with humid salt air, proving endurance has limits. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the relational crucible from full ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s barefoot stance, tactile star-seeking, and the quiet “unorthodox confidence” are embodied and consistent; the climactic choice to channel intent into the stone carries earned weight. Motivation is clear but leans declared (“to discover meaning”) rather than revealed through sharper contradiction; minor deduction for interiority that occasionally lapses into thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's insurgency and plant-telepathy root every move; telepathy directly enables each beat—finding the kite, guiding through lava, decoding by plant-memory. The embryo cradled at climax crystallizes her renegade motive, earned by prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. botanist’s nurture—are embodied in the freeze-thaw beat; the pearl pocketed beside the photograph crystallizes an earned renunciation whose cost is the continued ache of memory. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into therapy-speak. Micro-choice of plucking the nodule anchors his value hierarchy under pressure. One slip: “optimism in realism” is articulated rather than dramatized, blunting flaw complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s despair is viscerally embodied and the tarot-box compulsion is earned by prior interiority, but the “necessary darkness” motivation appears as epiphany rather than conflicted choice; final metamorphosis is asserted, not dramatized at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen’s “serene anger” is embodied in micro-choices—kneeling to study ink, deliberate spill, stepping into the swirl—each tethered to the family-loss backstory that sharpens the final cost. Interior contradiction (rage vs. calm) stays active in scene, not summary. The disappearance act is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (vanishing body, confirmed data). Minor slip: “consciously wild” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior conflict is palpable—her trembling hands, the “dizzying quiet” that mirrors her vertigo—but the pivot from conflict to resolve (“bravely conflicted no more”) is asserted rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. The final smile feels slightly premature given the enormity of the risk. Still, her embodied dread and the cost of isolation land well.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s pacifist stance and “senselessly perceptive” trait are dramatized through concrete micro-choices—tracing runes, whispering lessons, sheathing the trowel—each with visible cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory; her father’s absence is felt as pressure rather than exposition. The final renunciation (encasing violence in quiet resolve) is earned and forecloses pursuit. Minor drift: “inculcating plants with values” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eron’s calm is embodied in micro-choices—silent breaths, zigzag steps, the steady reel—so the renunciation at the end carries felt cost. Interior contradiction is muted; we sense longing but not simultaneous competing impulses, keeping him just shy of 9-band depth.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the “solemn playfulness” of twirling the pen—but the shift from passive observation to active intervention is asserted rather than dramatized; the journalist remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final resolve feels earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s guilt is embodied in amber and firmware; contradictory impulses (fear vs. need to hear) act simultaneously. Micro-choice—tattooing her own arm—directly links motive to closure. Cost is felt: she accepts eternal tether to daughter’s cry. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but “meteor hush” drifts toward poetic label.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “whimsical flair” and “quietly burning” motive anchor her—but the story never dramatizes an internal contradiction under pressure; her choices feel frictionless. The collective unlearners remain silhouettes, so relationship crucible is absent. The final smile is earned, yet the cost is diffuse rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—gentle radicalism vs. retrocognitive compulsion—shows in embodied beats (kneeling, tracing chips, pressing tessera) and motivates the renaming. The final smile registers cost: he remains trapped yet is no longer alone, a credible Earned Stasis. The retrocognitive flashes tilt toward summary rather than simultaneous contradiction, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s synesthetic interiority is vivid and embodied; her despair and the rising nostalgia are rendered through concrete sensory crossovers. Silas’s motivation—using Elara to grant himself an encore—reads clearly, though his interiority is less textured. The final choice (pocketing the coin) is a credible micro-choice that forecloses despair and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alex’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in micro-choices—handing Mia the geode, whispering “Let’s try”—and the final embrace shows earned softening. Interiority stays concrete: “fractally precise” visions overwhelm rather than diagnose. The cost is felt when his shoulders soften against her fear of disinterest. Minor slip: “willowglass hope” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive to “become the voice of the unknown” is vivid and embodied in her sensory mapping, but interior contradiction is thin; the fossil encounter sparks awe yet no clashing impulse. Micro-choice—placing the fossil on the scanner—advances goal, yet the final beat (following the floating leaf) feels more wonder-struck than costly. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eland’s interiority—“quiet rebellion against fate”—is specific and active, contradictions visible in tension between solitary duty and need for shared wisdom. Cost arrives when he chooses to catalog his own memory (the tarnished button) rather than only others’, locking the climax to prior cause.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to repair yet fearing exposure—surface in the micro-choice to kneel and etch snow-codes; the pillbox hand-off crystallizes a visible cost (trust, exposure). Interiority is embodied, not labeled. Mira’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters their shared state. The final renunciation of solitude is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the palimpsest needle-work shows micro-choices under pressure. Motivation (distill essence) is dramatized through tactile decoding, not stated. Final renunciation of personal gain carries visible cost—he boards the ferry “unweighted.” Minor slip: “spindrift serenity” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s calm curiosity and potter identity stay vivid in tactile detail, but his interior contradiction (zen detachment versus urgent drive) is summarized rather than embodied in moment-by-moment beats. The final gentle choice has earned emotional cost from earlier kindness acts, yet secondary-character absence keeps status dynamics and relationships inert.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“water’s chill kissing her skin”), but the “wistfully pragmatic” trait is asserted more than dramatized; her final smile feels earned yet the cost is muted, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (clinging vs. letting go) play out in real time. The final renunciation—choosing independence over spectral reunion—earns its cost through the prior beat of “coexisting and letting go.” Minor slip: “translate her profound loneliness into a fierce independence” edges toward label-speak, though the body of the scene dramatizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority—"words he penned for others, secrets he guarded like fragile eggs"—is character-specific, and the micro-choice to use his own secret as bait for reconnection lands at the cost of exposure. Interior contradiction is shown when his self-protective secrecy collides with the public act of unveiling. However, his past with Mira is summarized rather than dramatized, muting some emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembled slightly,” “quiet, cautious smile”), but the cosmic-trickster motive is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to broadcast interference is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s claustrophobia and prudently adventurous streak are embodied in every beat—his trembling hands, the deliberate breadcrumb checks, the childhood attic flashback that tilts his present stance. The final clutch of the key crystallizes an earned renunciation: the confined world he knew is gone, cost paid in wistful sorrow. Interior contradiction (fear vs. yearning) is dramatized, not labeled. Only a hairline slip: “wistful rebellion” recurs as shorthand rather than fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s prosopagnosia and methodical nature are dramatized through his forensic sketching and tactile investigation; the final empathy awakening is earned by the ribbon’s reprise and the memorial’s cost. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between detachment and the felt fear he paints into Lila’s eyes. The flaw of emotional dormancy is confronted, not cured, leaving a credible residual ache.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s idealism and dread are embodied in trembling hands and soaked floors; the copper nail as inherited curse/ key gives her a tactile micro-choice that forecloses safety. Interior contradiction—honor vs. station-endangering obsession—drives the final resolve. The ancestral weight is specific, not generic, and the cost (leaving the station into the storm) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s calm is embodied in micro-choices (the silent boundary ritual) and carries a visible cost—he forfeits direct confrontation. Interiority is specific, but the father-legacy conflict is more summarized than dramatized in-scene, muting contradictory impulses at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara reveals believable interior conflict between self-protective solitude and healing empathy; renunciation of isolation at the dream telegraph is earned, with visible cost in the self-revelation “share my burden.” Dialogue phrasings occasionally drift into therapeutic polish, but embodied emotion in the dream sequence props it up. Relationships exist only as projected dream contact, yet the stakes feel proportionate to the story length. Motivation stays laser-focused on decoding and agency.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s guarded-warrior interiority is vivid and embodied; the “warlike serenity” refrain threads through every beat, culminating in the unbending of her own walls. Motivation (“what mirrors don’t show”) is dramatized, not stated, and the final absorption of the confession lands as earned cost. Minor slip: the “flesh-eating seed” feels slightly external to her psyche rather than an organic extension of her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through the deliberate act of pressing the clipping into her scar; the interior contradiction between anxious dread and elation is embodied in the fused agony/ecstasy moment. The final choice to sever her roots carries a visible cost (“risking her very essence”) and is foreshadowed by the network of shared wounds. Minor slip: the phrase “root-bound visionary” is repeated as label rather than shown through fresh action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reckless idealism and fiercely gentle nature are embodied in every micro-choice—she offers compassion to the spectral Keeper, trades her own destiny without hedging, and accepts inherited torment. Interiority is concrete and specific, never drifting into label-speak. The final inheritance of her brother’s shadow is a felt cost that forecloses her prior path. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jack’s interior contradiction—confidence in facts vs. doubt in purpose—is embodied in the trembling hands and the decision to buy the cloth. The “confidently uncertain” label is repeated rather than dramatized, and Earl’s cameo adds no pressure, but the final micro-choice (pocketing the cloth) forecloses appraisal-as-escape with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his measured grief and analogical mind convincingly inform every micro-choice. The final taste of the fruit and the changed relationship with Mira land as earned, not symbolic shorthand. Only a slight residue of therapeutic self-awareness in the closing sentence blunts full 8+ sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s moon-phase identity shift is embodied in the new-moon introspection that enables the smelting ritual; the motivation to “preserve wonder” is dramatized through the concrete act of fusing identities and gifting the result to a weary dweller. Interiority is specific and gear-tinged (“geared heart,” “whirring softly”), and the final renunciation—accepting contradiction—carries visible cost as he shelves another tome and readies for the next tide. Minor slip: the monk/sailor identities are sketched more than lived, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s solitary-guard stance is embodied in micro-choices (hovering hand, boot-crunch) and the final crown act is earned by the confessional spiral. Interiority is specific—his wife’s laughter, child’s questions—yet the shift from numb inspector to bearer of hope feels slightly compressed; one more beat of embodied resistance would clinch full contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt, methodical daring, and grief are embodied in tactile micro-choices—unfolding the map, tracing graffiti, lifting the patched accordion—each action tightening his need for self-forgiveness. The interior contradiction (seeking absolution while fearing it) stays active in scene, culminating in the earned, cost-laden decision to play the accordion and accept the flood-altered path. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV interiority is vivid and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“her heart thrumming with cautious exuberance”—and her micro-choice to pocket the watch for its rumored time-bending feels character-rooted. The moment she whispers “Steady, lest the cycle claims you” crystallizes an embodied, contradictory impulse under pressure. The final gesture of stepping back while carrying “the weight of words” is an earned renunciation with cost. Cap remains at 8.7 because the second fated letter is off-page; no new pressure tests current stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictions—scholar’s rigor against private yearning—live in embodied motion; every micro-choice in the greenhouse and at the violin re-weights destiny. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic filler. Renunciation of total escape is earned by causal triangulation of dream, empire, and plant-voice cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s desire to preserve the dying’s final spark is enacted through tactile ritual and micro-choices; the internal contradiction—beautifying death while defying it—drives every beat and earns the final renunciation of her own spark.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her forgiveness of the mentor is dramatized through the ritual with the hairpin, not summarized. The “kindly decisive” trait is shown when she swiftly assesses Lir and chooses the ritual, with visible cost in the sparks of light and the pinning of the veil. The final renunciation of vengeance in favor of caregiving is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost. Minor slip: Lir’s flickering aura is labeled rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—detached performer vs. emerging vulnerability—is embodied in the moment the mask cracks when he hears the chimes’ harmonic chord. Mara’s micro-choice to don the cloak and unhook the logbook crystallizes her shift from certainty to doubt with visible cost. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic label-speak (“protected vulnerability”) that blunts immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interior contradictions (aging yet youthful) are embodied, but dialogue-free; her withheld-reveal motivation is credible and pays off with cost, yet Lir remains slightly too sponge-like to up the crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the skimmer’s centuries of vigilance and weathered resolve are palpable. Motivation to “navigate without moving” is rooted in the canyon’s dislodged pulse and drives the final stillness. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s quiet longing is embodied in tactile cold and fumbling fingers; the final weeping lands as earned cost. Interior contradiction—yearning for wonder while fearing his own inadequacy—remains vivid. Micro-choice to unstrap the keystone crystallizes values under pressure. Flaw: “underachiever” is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s synesthetic quest is vivid and embodied; the moment he whispers his vow while clutching the tag crystallizes interior stakes. Yet the grandfather-map backstory is delivered as summary, not tested under pressure, and no contradictory impulse complicates the final choice—he simply receives the gift.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “quietly enthusiastic resolve” and trembling hands under stellar doubt embody contradictory impulses. The coins as lots anchor her micro-choices and visibly cost her certainty. Motivation to “wavelength align” is dramatized through distillation beats, not labels. Final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she accepts guardianship of the next cycle, doubt harnessed as fuel.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The reaper’s interiority is vivid—his grief is embodied in the “weight of a love reaped too soon”—but the contradictory impulses (duty vs. love) are stated rather than dramatized in real time. The final act of naming crystallizes his arc, yet the cost feels more narrated than lived. Still, the voice is specific and the micro-choice (adjusting mirrors to trap light) is character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elandor’s lukewarm magic and brittle devotion are embodied in trembling hands and sweat; the final tolling of the bell crystallizes a visible cost (his naïveté tempered). Interiority is specific—his earnest counting of drips, his doubt—but the “naive heart” line edges toward label-speak, blunting contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—callused fingers on the photo, the buried ache surfacing—yet the decisive shift from isolation to communal storytelling is more declared than dramatized; the cost is felt but not embodied in a single irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—rigorous logic vs. sentimental trust—are dramatized in the flame-casting beat; the tear she sheds seals the cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and drives the final choice. The sentimental trait is not merely labeled but constrains her method and exacts a visible price. No slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied (thumb on buckle, chest pressure) and her contradictory impulses—duty vs. fear of failure—drive the revision. The final choice to tether-parachute is earned by prior muscle-memory drills and carries visible communal cost. Secondary pressure from radio voices is thin but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction—detachment vs thaw—is embodied in micro-choices (gripping the blade, placing the brain at center) rather than summary. Motivation stays rooted in trait: Kai’s numbness persists until the unified chant melts it. The final renunciation (shared identity) costs the illusion of pure autonomy—felt cost on page. Brief drift toward label-speak (“inner frost”) narrowly avoids deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias's motivation to safeguard creative spaces is told-and-repeated rather than dramatized; his choices at the brook are reflective, not decisive. Relationship pressure (rival copy-cats) remains off-stage, so character change feels asserted. Interiority uses stock phrases ("storm-born silence") without body. Self is present but not pressed hard enough for a strong arc.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s mournfully eager drive is embodied in every spectral tug of the cord; the contradiction between lingering grief and active caretaking is dramatized, not labeled. Interiority is concrete—translucent fingers, off-key wind—yet the arc stays ghost-static, renouncing reunion, so the cost is felt but not deepened by a final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s contradictory impulses—feral instinct vs. scholar’s longing—are embodied in its clawed grasp of the pendant and the growl that acknowledges transformation. Interiority is concrete (“dimensionally homesick,” “ache of displacement”) and drives the micro-choice to interiorize the garden. The Earned Stasis—accepting exile by folding the garden inward—carries visible cost: the pendant cools, dawn arrives, exile remains. Flaws (feral solitude, cosmic displacement) shape every beat; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in every hammer blow and sweat-wipe; the interior contradiction between despair and resolve is dramatized through micro-choices rather than labels. The final renunciation of the curse is earned by the prior chain of destruction/creation, with the phoenix-staff image carrying visible cost. Minor slip: “hopelessness wavered, not vanishing, but transforming” edges toward summary rather than embodied shift.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots scrape, her palm hums, her mentor-loss fuels a credible quest. The final smile and pragmatic packing crystallize her arc without tidy epiphany. Minor: the “philosophy born from watching too many worlds crumble” edges toward summary rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s resilient optimism is embodied in his radio calls and hourglass handling, but interior contradiction is thin; we never feel him doubt. The final smile lands as earned stasis, yet the cost (lost alternate selves?) is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief-driven quest is embodied in tactile micro-choices (threading, weaving, reaching) that escalate to the final touch of “warm, fibrous” connection; the interior contradiction—yearning vs. acceptance—remains active in-scene. The sister’s projection is credibly imagined, not sentimental, and the cost (spent thread, dissolved pattern) is visible. Minor slip: “fever dream architect” is more label than lived vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “somber marvel” and “quiet vow” crystallize his contradictory impulses. The anchor chain link functions as an extension of his psyche, constraining and enabling the final choice. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Motivation to navigate by starlight is dramatized through iterative micro-choices and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradiction—needing closure for ghosts yet fearing her own—energizes every action; the embodied shame of twisting an old hearing aid and the ultimate renunciation (assuring the woman while forfeiting her own reunion) read as earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alex’s claustrophobia and compulsion to “stand by the unremembered” are embodied in the breath-by-breath crawl through narrowing corridors and the underwater push; the final renunciation of fear is earned by the prior physical ordeal. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“motivation crystallized”) edge toward summary. The micro-choice to recite the codex under rising tide pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alex’s interiority is vivid—heartbeat counting as embodied mantra—but the arc from “officially dead” to “peace with resurrection” relies more on setting mood than on tense choices; the decision to defragment Elara is motivating yet feels externally prompted, blurring agency.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied in copper-veined skin and the tactile vocabulary of bark/silk; the final endurance—emerging with veins thrumming—shows cost. Yet the shift from observer to actor is compressed; more contradiction mid-scene would lift it to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s bitterness-to-cosmic-joke arc is embodied in every beat: the arrowhead’s tug, the confessional phone call, the bodily metamorphosis. Contradictory impulses—grief vs. ironic triumph—co-exist in scene, culminating in the earned, visible cost of her humanity. Minor slip: “frostbitten hope” edges toward label-speak mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied through her violin playing, but interiority leans toward lyrical summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene; the locust shell functions as a charged object but does not force a visible micro-choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet defiance and embodied care for the parcels anchor every beat; the contradictory impulses—courtesy vs. smuggling—play out in micro-choices under drone glare. The final “It’s through” carries a felt cost (risk of capture) that forecloses safer paths. Interiority stays concrete, though the woman’s hollowness is sketched more than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s lifelong muteness is embodied in the tactile way he “traces its curved edge” of the halo; the contradictory impulse to speak finally erupts in song, costing him his defining silence. The micro-choice to kneel and touch the fragment crystallizes his hierarchy of values—art over safety—and the final renunciation of muteness is earned by the entire pattern of wordless carving. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only drag is a brief “memories flooded him” summary that abstracts rather than dramatizes the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and eccentric, but her contradictory impulses remain mostly ornamental; the final “quiet triumph” is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost. The scarf as memory-anchor is embodied, yet the stakes of losing or altering it are never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Solid interiority, though the ‘lost lover’ longing is stated more than dramatized; the final moment of “reclaimed light” provides a clear earned change. Motivation steadies but never fully complicates: Elara pursues exactly what we expect, no contradictory impulse under pressure. Still, micro-choice (infusing filters at dawn) aligns with traits; Renunciation/Stasis feels proportionate. Missing stronger internal contradiction or visible flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s longing and the lock of hair anchor every beat; the final renunciation—offering the hair as key—carries visible cost. Interiority is embodied (“tears mingled with the hush”) rather than labeled. The only minor slip is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis in “mend the rift in his soul,” but it does not derail the earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s curiosity and regret are embodied through tactile micro-choices (pressing the mushroom, mapping the “stars”), but the decades-later return is compressed into summary, muting the internal contradiction between safety and risk. The final smile feels earned yet the cost of reintegration is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—archival detachment vs. fierce mentorship—are dramatized in her circling Kael and the backward-step tic; Kael’s mirrored retreat shows earned absorption of her guidance. The final smile and shard archiving crystallize her cost: she must let the student go. Minor slip: “mentor resilience quietly” is slightly label-speak mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s inner drive—“to preserve the color of wonder”—is vivid and embodied in every micro-choice, from opening the locket to kneeling in moss, but the final beat risks sentimental summary rather than raw, contradicted emotion. The insatiable creativity is shown in pruning gestures, not merely labeled. Interiority remains specific and textured; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her guilt and dread surface in trembling hands and prismatic shadows. The ancestral tie to the saboteur supplies a credible flaw that complicates the final choice. Yet the moment of self-reproach—“she had known the secret from old letters”—leans toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied contradiction, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “shielded openness” and tactile empathy are embodied in micro-choices like pressing the torn map together. The contradiction between methodical curiosity and empathic vulnerability drives every beat. The final renunciation (mending silence, not excavating) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “interpreting silence with empathy” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-driven quest is embodied in tactile micro-choices (robotic pincers, tablet notes) and culminates in a credible renunciation; the interior contradiction between analytic detachment and emotional need is dramatized, not labeled. The final “equilibrium” is earned by the prior untangling beats and carries visible cost—he powers down the lights, letting the library fade. Minor slip: the “physics of letting go” phrase edges toward thesis-speak, but the embodied action redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s ache for connection is embodied in the binary roses he etches; the contradiction between ghostly detachment and tactile creation is vivid. Lira’s arrival supplies immediate relational pressure that crystallizes Elowen’s choice, but her interiority is thin, muting the crucible effect. The final nod carries earned cost—his code unravels with audible loss—yet the prior beats lean on lyric summary rather than micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—grief for lost family vs. hunger for hidden joy—are embodied in the micro-choice to preserve rather than burn the diary; the cost (remaining servant yet now keeper of encrypted light) is legible and scaled to the word count. Interiority is concrete, e.g., “affectionate detachment” guiding his fingers as he folds the brittle cover. No stock phrasing; voice stays particular to Elias’s perceptual signature. The final stance crystallizes under pressure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s meteorologist lens renders interiority sharp and particular; his cloud-emotion taxonomy is embodied emotion under pressure. One credible renunciation—the decision to relinquish perfect knowledge for felt memory—lands as earned stasis with visible cost. Flaws (rage, longing) complicate every beat. Only a hair of therapy-speak creeps in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s face-blindness and artistic compulsion are embodied in tactile brushwork and fractal tracing; the interior contradiction—yearning for infinity while hitting human limits—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (accepting the portrait can only approximate the sky) lands with visible cost: trembling hands, sealed coin, imminent loss. No secondary character pressure, but single-POV interiority is rich and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s curiosity drives every beat from first telescope glance to final fold of phrasebook; interior contradictions (longing vs isolation) are embodied in trembling hands and racing heart. Micro-choice—deciding to kneel and translate chalk inscriptions—alters tactics mid-scene. Renunciation of anonymity by embracing future explorers carries felt social cost ("carrying the promise of wonders yet to be charted"). No slips; curiosity never reduced to label.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s yearning to “learn the rhythm of repair” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—uncapping the gear, arranging cogs on the ice—yet interiority drifts into nostalgic summary rather than live contradiction; the final image crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost (tears freeze), satisfying the 9+ quick test despite some reflective padding.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characters are sketched warmly but generically; the ghost’s altruism is asserted rather than embodied, and the family’s “reexamination” is reported, not dramatized through micro-choices. No interior contradiction or embodied emotion is shown; stakes pivot on group consensus rather than individual cost. Closure is communal, but the personal price feels diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s scarred hands, the puppet head, and the lullaby motive are embodied and specific; the final renunciation—accepting delay but not aversion of the end—carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“bruised awe”) edge toward label-speak. The contradiction between duty and compassion is dramatized in the act of pressing the puppet to the pane. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s reluctant-caretaker role is embodied in her trudging boots and “graceless murmur,” but her interiority is mostly summary (“reluctance burned like a slow fire”). The inherited duty to guide travelers is stated rather than dramatized; the final turn—choosing to stay—rests on lineage rather than a fresh contradiction exposed in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her grief is rendered through tactile observation of foam and chrysalis. The contradiction between her scientific precision and emotional imprecision is dramatized when she kneels to trace the foam, not merely stated. The final micro-choice—handing the sculpture to Lila—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Minor deduction for one moment of diagnostic self-awareness (“empty chrysalis now a shared talisman”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and conflicted—her mercantile persona versus her scholarly hunger—embodied in the tactile arrangement of slates and the bodily urgency of pouring moonlight. Micro-choices (uncorking, incising, descending) reveal her shifting hierarchy of values, and her final renunciation of vendor identity carries a palpable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s guilt over infecting his lover is palpable, but the interiority slips into summary (“gnawed at him”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final integration of remorse is dramatized through taste-alchemy, yet the lover’s absence keeps relationship pressure off-stage. Motivation is clear and stakes personal, but the micro-choice to absorb the orb feels slightly under-cooked in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “vigorous tender resolve” is embodied in the cool pulse of the cuckoo weight—but the shift from solitary librarian to community architect is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to complicate her certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s helix-minded trait is embodied in concrete visualizations and micro-choices; the interior contradiction between profit-driven past and dream-archaeologist future is dramatized through the memory-rewriting ritual. The final renunciation of his old identity carries visible cost—he pockets the mirror and walks into an unknown dawn—earning the transformation. Minor slip: “synaptic plasticity” is named rather than fully dramatized, a hairline therapy-speak intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s prism-minded trait is embodied in her split-second tactical refractions under pressure; the orb-grab moment crystallizes her obsession with a visible cost (nearly ensnared). Interiority stays concrete, but a few “latent blaze” abstractions edge toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning for sound yet fearing the cost of failure—surface in micro-choices (tracing cracks, adjusting touch). The final strumming sequence crystallizes her values and exacts a visible emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. A slight reserve: the hedgehog’s presence, while atmospheric, never pressures her choice, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias is sharply drawn through embodied micro-reacts (thumb in dent, toe-scuff, adjust stance under magnetic pull) and contradictory impulses—vulnerability masked as precision, exile softened by curiosity—that culminate in an earned quiet renunciation, sealing his arc with felt cost on arrival at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s pacifism and cataloguing obsession are embodied in every micro-choice; the final forgiveness is earned by the prior refusal to fight and the costly act of listening. Interiority is vivid, though occasional “theatrical” self-awareness nudges it toward performance rather than raw contradiction. The estranged brother’s pain is rendered through recovered silences, not exposition, satisfying the crucible test.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory gift and ambition collide in embodied micro-choices (planting the seed, inhaling the stench). The final renunciation of conquest for “quiet undercurrents” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the village’s repulsion, her own nausea). Minor slip: the grandmother backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly diluting the family-custom payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive—save her family’s orchard—drives every beat; her embodied fear and wonder under inversion are vivid. Interiority stays concrete, but the final leap into the glider feels slightly under-costed; we don’t feel the physical risk of gravity normalizing. Still, her contradictory awe and desperation ring true, and the choice to seize the arrow tip is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear-cut—she wants to cultivate foresight in action—but the narrative only asserts this trait at key junctures rather than manifesting it in contradictory felt choices. Interiority lacks intimate contradiction under hazard; “hazy precision” becomes a convenient tag rather than a lived stance. The patch discovery causes a minor tactical recalibration, but the emotional and moral cost of reframing the crash feels under-dramatized; the ending gestures at change without a moment of renunciation or irrevocable decision on screen.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (synesthetic color blooms, “oscillating repose”), and her motive to “certify wonder” drives every strike. Yet the final choice is more ritual completion than active renunciation; the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, capping the arc just shy of Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her shame over the lost amulet and her resolve to “harvest insights” are dramatized through the ritual’s micro-choices. The final renunciation—turning from solitary hoarding to alliance—is earned by the visions and carries visible cost in her dismantled markers. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met, but the arc is credible and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—detached mathematician vs. fragmented borrower—drives every beat; the borrowed astronomer grief and lover rage are embodied, not labeled. The final renunciation (“refusal to be fully solved”) is earned by the prior transpositions and carries visible cost in his shattered identity mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s jittery courier persona is vivid and embodied; her trembling hands and the pendant’s hum anchor interiority. The mentor-shaped absence (Thorne) is felt as pressure, not exposition. The final choice—handing over the pendant—carries visible cost (loss of relic, Thorne’s mythic fade) and aligns with her motive. Minor slip: Kael’s interiority is granted without POV cue.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's interiority is vivid and embodied—prism in hand, breath steady, stance rooted—but her final epiphany for Marcus is asserted more than dramatized by prior choice; the cost lands emotionally yet feels narrated rather than earned in micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her stoically sparkling eyes, the amber bead she threads, the felt pull of years unraveling from her lifeline. The contradiction between preserving memories and losing her own future is embodied in every weave, culminating in the Earned Stasis of her dissolution. Minor slip: “latent sacrifice” is named rather than dramatized once or twice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elar’s meek resolve is embodied in soft hammer-strikes and deliberate descent; the barter of silence for stone-strength shows contradictory impulses (fear vs resolve) and exacts a felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “quietly determined” label is repeated rather than deepened under pressure. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Overall, a credible, character-driven endurance arc.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shard’s pulse against her palm and the ozone-metallic scent anchor her sensory map-maker identity. Contradictory impulses—yearning for truth versus fear of its cost—surface in micro-choices like the fierce redirect that risks multiverse loss. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she shoulders the silence no longer, earning a credible shift. Minor slip: “burden of silence that had warped her life” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s reticence and “warmly observant” trait are embodied in micro-choices—stacking stones, selecting sea glass, kneeling amid ghosts—yet interior contradiction remains muted; the ache is named more than dramatized. Motivation (“bottle the feeling of safety”) drives every beat, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally stinging at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s interiority is vivid—her “shadowed elation” and embodied laughter anchor her spectral presence—but the story never tests her motivation against a live obstacle; her choices remain ritualistic rather than adaptive, so the arc feels circular, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—dye-master’s eye for color, borrowed-heart ache—but the final shift to “magnetizing his own narrative” feels slightly abstract; the cost is implied rather than embodied. The tea-house mistress is more oracle than pressure, so relationship crucible is thin. Still, the contradictory impulses (caution vs. curiosity) play out in real time through the wing’s shimmer and the sun-trail pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with what trees witness is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling for the sextant, aligning its lens, aching hands—yet interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “mundane miracle” rhetoric rather than raw contradiction. The final renunciation (pocketing the sextant and resuming work) is earned, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally stinging.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (captivity vs. liberation) are embodied in the “tone of bound release” and in her trembling hands at the end. Motivation is clear and intensifies: from scattered fragments to deliberate song-weaving. The final choice—singing the realm back to life—carries visible cost (trembling, exhaustion) and earns her wholeness. Minor slip: “scattered memory keeper” is more label than lived trait until late.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory desire to withdraw yet help is dramatized in two concrete beats—hesitating at the hidden door and slipping a note to the newcomer—embodied rather than told. His reclusion-as-paradox motif is threaded cleanly into his micro-choice to “stay while leaving” at midnight, forging the Cost as his silent note both connects and widens the emotional gulf. Minor slips: a touch of explanatory interiority (“his empathetic pull toward potential healing urged him forward”) and the abstract label “enlarged tranquility” used twice without fresh embodiment each time. Overall, though, his flaws, choices, and final restraint satisfy the 9+ contradictory-impulse test.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet guilt and gentle resolve are embodied in tactile micro-choices (crumbling bread, testing soil). The contradiction between passive watching and active redemption is held in scene, not summary. Final renunciation—accepting tenuous absolution—carries visible cost as he kneels amid the mosaic. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—aligning lenses, sealing vials—so the trait is not just labeled but lived. Interiority is consistent and particular, though the absence of a second character limits relational crucible. The final act of sealing the vials carries visible cost (trembling hands), earning the closure under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—vengeance vs. need for closure—surface in embodied micro-choices (twisting the fob, tripping the lantern). The final renunciation of open confrontation in favor of recorded betrayal carries visible cost: she forfeits direct revenge for a quieter, more haunting justice. Interiority stays concrete, though “quest for vengeance disguised as closure” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied in her wary interiority and the micro-choice to taste the mist; the final softening of doubt is earned by the ring-guided encounter and the cost of inherited nostalgia. Yet the weather-carrier remains archetypal, giving her no relational crucible, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—perfect memory vs. creative paralysis—is embodied in trembling charcoal fingers and the chest he once locked. The micro-choice to paint a self-portrait as a retrieval tool crystallizes his hierarchy of values (art over force) and carries visible cost: the risk of damaging irreplaceable sketches. The final tears and renewed sketching earn the change through prior causality. Minor slip: “auroral sorrow” drifts toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s yearning for lost candor is tangible and individualized through sensory memory ("parched voids in her soul"); however, interiority flirts with diagnostic therapy-speak (“wilt of leaves, find the bloom of honesty”) that undercuts the embodied heat at climax. The end—where she emerges "renewed"—remains more assertion than earned cost traced through body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her tactile tuning of bells, but interior contradiction is muted; the “color of wonder” stays abstract and never collides with a counter-desire on the page, so the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—mechanical caretaker vs. nostalgic mourner—are dramatized in the moment she kneels to shrink the fears; the final choice to burn and flee is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the farm). Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “her circuits humming with echoes of laughter and tears.”

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s interior motive—“to prove that listening heals”—is stated early and reiterated, but her contradictory impulses are not dramatized in scene; she moves from witness to facilitator without visible internal cost or micro-choice under pressure. The final embrace is affective, yet the change in her own grief is asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calm defiance is embodied in every pirouette and dice roll—but the story leans on lyrical summary rather than on-page contradiction; the final dance is earned yet the cost feels more poetic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific; the deleted-memory ache is dramatized through the floating pebbles and the “voids in his mind.” His final micro-choice—pocketing the wildflowers and stepping toward the whale—earns the closure by foreclosing retreat. The only drag is a brief lapse into diagnostic phrasing (“mending the holes in his soul”) that softens the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s interior monologue aligns action with motive, yet occasionally leans into thematic label-speak ("tranquil blaze of determination"); the crane wing, brook, and origami are concretely embodied and influence micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s desire to “learn the language of old buildings” is vivid and embodied; his weekly returns under doubt show escalating stakes. Mira functions as catalyst more than crucible—her choices remain opaque, muting relationship pressure. Interiority is specific, but the final epiphany leans summary rather than dramatized contradiction. Cost is felt yet diffuse, not pinned to a single renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s skeptical yearning is embodied in tactile micro-choices—clutching the shell, kneeling, humming—each exposing the contradiction between doubt and desire. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: isolation is not escaped but reforged into autonomy, the garden’s hush confirming the price paid. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, though the “ghostly resolve” refrain edges close to abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her quietly enduring patience is embodied in the slow drip of stalactites and the calibrated pressure of each forged stroke. The contradiction between her need to forgive Silas and her compulsion to finish his betrayal is dramatized in the final beat when she presses the thorn into the key. Cost is felt: she accepts that Silas’s abandonment was protection, a renunciation that forecloses nostalgic resentment. Minor slip: the mentor’s absence is summarized rather than shown in-scene, slightly blunting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing for her mother’s lost voice is palpable and drives every step; the moment she sings to free the echoes crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Interiority is concrete (“ache in her soul,” “sharp against her palm”) and embodied. Yet the final renunciation of trapping echoes is slightly under-motivated—no prior beat shows her weighing control versus release.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath fogging the visor”), but the final choice—how she will “weave the truth carefully”—is stated rather than dramatized, muting the felt cost. The ghosts’ chorus supplies pressure, yet Elara’s contradictory impulses remain off-stage, so the renunciation reads as pre-decided.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile attention to nets, moon paths, and tea foam shows embodied contradiction between quiet rebellion and village pragmatism. The final vow to teach villagers carries felt cost (foreclosing his solitary stance), earned by the prior ritual of whisking and whistling. Minor drift: “philosopher” remains more label than demonstrated worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s drive to expose lies is clear and embodied in every beat; his micro-choice to pocket the diamond crystallizes the cost of truth. Interiority is specific—his scoffing at curses, the racing heart—but the final beat leans on summary rather than a fully dramatized contradiction. Still, the flaw feels proportionate to the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “lyrically prophetic” voice is embodied in murmured verses and callused fingers on dials—but the shift from isolated hermit to movement-leader is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost of his variant allegiance. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so the crucible is purely internal; the contradiction between scientific past and prophetic present is stated more than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction pulses through Elias’s need to “sweeten bitterness” while hoarding loss in wax-sealed jars; the grandfather-laugh–lullaby fusion finally crystallizes his contradictory desire to preserve yet rewrite the past. The final smile carries credible cost—he keeps the lone loft, the jars stay sealed for others, not himself—Earned Stasis. Some minor emotional abstractness (“lonesome splendor,” “haunted dreams”) blurs embodiment but never derails the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s logically emotional nature is embodied in the vibrational tuning sequence; the orb’s absolution forces him to confront his own guilt with felt cost. Interiority is specific—calloused hands, azure coat as lover’s breath—yet the final self-absolution risks a hairline slip into tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—restrained wildness vs. patient strategist—drives every micro-choice; the final magnetized pulse is earned by her prior mapping and the visible cost of holding the exiles’ rage in check. One slip: “impatience transformed into enduring strength” edges toward label-speak just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fortified vulnerability mirroring her own state”), but the final liberation feels slightly under-motivated; the bloodline curse is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choices (kneeling to time the hum, whispering the incantation) are specific and costly, yet the shift from haunted to free resolves with minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt and desire for redemption are palpable and embodied in his meticulous care for the clockwork heart; Lena’s arrival crystallizes the crucible. The apology-to-action motive is dramatized, not declared, and the final mutual forgiveness carries a felt cost. Minor deduction: Lena’s interiority is sketched more than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s yearning is embodied in every whirring gear and irreverent chuckle; the algorithm’s ache is his own. The final strike of the gong crystallizes his refusal to accept stasis, with the acid sea itself as witness to the cost. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak, only the hunger of a bored tinkerer turned prophet. One slip: the “steady curiosity” label is repeated rather than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s obsession with the 47s and lost crew is clear, but the interior complexity—how this drive collides with her loyalty to corporate secrecy—stays more asserted than enacted. Her decision to lie to the AI is consequential, yet it arrives near the close with little prior friction from contradictory self-interests.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her calm intuition and shadow-laced nature manifest in concrete micro-choices (arranging mirrors, weaving visions). Motivation to “map empathy onto action” drives every beat, culminating in earned reconstitution. Minor slip: “courageous anomaly” is asserted more than dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet volunteering to salvage life—are embodied in her tactile use of the parasol tip; the final renunciation of passive surrender is earned through prior beats and carries visible cost as she trawls on in the storm. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “changed self anchored” edges toward summary rather than embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s gentle-rooted vigil and Mira’s wanderlust are sketched with embodied contradiction (his fingers tracing the letter, her fingers brushing it anew). The final renunciation—accepting mismatched destiny—earns its cost through their shared night of parallels, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward summary rather than simultaneous impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elar’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority is mostly abstract ("wisdom echoes," "quiet triumph") rather than embodied. The final choice to consecrate the parapet is motivated, yet the cost feels reported rather than lived. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; the character moves with near-perfect certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is consistent and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the “quiet magic of collective healing” is stated rather than dramatized as a personal risk. The final renunciation—fading into the background—earns mild resonance yet lacks a visible cost on her own heart.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s reticence and “weathered innocence” are embodied in micro-choices—kneeling, silent listening, placing the crystal back—rather than labels. The interior contradiction between obedience to stasis and hunger for growth is dramatized when he decides to “testify” to the library itself, a renunciation that forecloses open rebellion yet carries felt cost in perpetual solitude. Motivation remains character-bound and intensifies to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to capture aging’s sound while cursed to forget—drives every beat; embodied micro-choices (chalk circles, driftwood arrows) externalize the struggle. The final Earned Stasis—accepting the endless return of longing—pays the cost of perpetual incompleteness. One slip: “tidal longing” is repeated rather than deepened under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s luminous ache and need to “harness the ephemeral” are embodied in the spinning clock and trembling dome, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the leaf-fall beat finally crystallizes motive into action with visible cost, yet earlier beats lean on lyrical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rage at the smashed record vs. longing for forgiveness—embodies on-page tension. Elara’s kindness has teeth (hologram arranged) but feels lightly sketched; her drive doesn’t compound a flaw. The father-daughter payoff lands as credible emotional cost, earning Elias’s final peace.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “quietly deliberate” stance is shown through micro-choices (steady breath, measured finger-work) rather than labels. The final confrontation with her own shadow supplies a credible, earned cost that forecloses a path. Minor slip: the mentor’s key is inherited rather than earned on-page, slightly softening the personal stake.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s forgiving skepticism is dramatized through her deliberate pocketing of the bone fragment and her measured incantations, showing contradictory impulses in scene. The interiority is specific—her “shrewdly innocent eyes” scanning for markers—and her final kneeling act is earned by prior causality. The micro-choice to fuse tooth and bone crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Minor slip: the daughter’s fate is revealed rather than chosen, muting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for stars yet renouncing fire—drives every micro-choice; the sea-glass pearl crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“her fingers coaxing”) and grounded micro-decisions anchor the arc. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation intensifies cleanly to the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to hide yet rebuild) coexist in scene. The pendant’s weight and the garden’s hush externalize her conflict, and her final choice to share it is earned by the quiet pressure of the moss sanctuary. The second character arrives late, so relationship crucible is thin, but Elara’s micro-choice to proffer the pendant carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—needing stolen hopes to keep writing while recoiling from the theft—tracks cleanly; the theft-ache deepens with every “cameo” so his final crushing of the shell lands as earned renunciation. Emotions manifest in embodied tension: the shell cutting his palm, muscles straining against the mist-current. No epiphanies are articulated, only a visceral gesture that forecloses any further harvesting. The cost is on-page and specific—loss of his invented anchor in exchange for autonomous authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his whimsical chuckle under pressure, the vine bracelet as embodied choice—but the “golden stories” trait remains abstract until the final song, blunting the internal contradiction needed for 9+. Motivation is clear and consistent; the cost is felt in the fading moonlight and relinquished tendril.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her heartbeat ache, the embodied stillness—but the contradiction between her stated goal (map heartbeats) and the actual ritual (seal starlight into a plate) is never dramatized; the final map feels gifted rather than earned by her flaw or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “peripheral focus” is embodied in how he studies light and shadow—but the story leans on summary rather than scene for the decisive restoration beat, blunting the cost of his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Weaver’s motive—collecting burdens to balance her own—is clear and embodied in ritual action; interiority stays concrete (“her form shimmering like a mandelbrot mirage”). Yet the traveler’s regret is sketched generically, and the weaver’s contradictory impulse (to free herself by deepening her own recursion) is asserted more than dramatized, keeping her from full individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her fingers tracing the blank, the scent of ash—but the shift from passive grief to active carving is slightly under-motivated; the “harvest lessons” motive is stated rather than dramatized. The final smile feels earned yet light on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the camera wheel while fearing its revelations—play out in embodied micro-choices (twisting the wheel to “wind the words”). The ghost’s accusation crystallizes her internal fracture, and her final pocketing of the wheel signals earned, costly resolve. One slip: the phrase “regret bloomed in her chest” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s stoic wonder and engineer mind ring clear; her micro-decisions (re-welding valves, sighting angles) directly drive every next beat and her final stand of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's regret and artistic yearning are embodied through trembling hands, tears, and the exacting way he kneels to “listen” to the crystals, yet the internal shift—acceptance rather than new action—edges toward summary, holding the score shy of the 8.5 bar.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—hunger for truth yet chronic deception—drives every micro-choice from the dive to the dawn repudiation. Embodied regret (“marriage crumbled”) anchors motive without therapy-speak. The final renunciation is charged: he keeps the forged scrolls as deliberate warning, not trophy—tangible cost undercuts triumph. A hair-slip in causality: the sundial never re-appears in the dawn beat, leaving the link to his reset slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his patience is dramatized through tactile knot-work and whispered questions to rope. The final acceptance of the enchanted seed is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (cold, time, solitude). Minor drift: the weaver’s dialogue is slightly expository, softening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s motive—“obituaries for the living”—is introduced early, but it stays abstract; no concrete micro-choice under pressure shows it altering tactics. Interiority is evocative (“mapping how wounds mended in distant lands”) yet remains expository rather than enacted on the page. The final choice to “explain” Mira’s absence is one beat of projected empathy, not an earned internal crisis. Consequently the character is atmospheric rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elandor’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his trembling hands, tattered robes, and obsessive hypotheses all reveal a mind fraying under isolation. The contradictory impulses (yearning for beauty vs. fear of tainted revival) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in the choice to activate the cradle despite visible corruption. The final renunciation—accepting flawed beauty as the only path—carries felt cost in his tears and the bird’s metallic sheen. Minor slip: “hypothesized about everything” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—compassion for the sapling and inherited guilt—are embodied in the grafting act; the coin/thread binding literalizes the cost of her father’s legacy. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she stands beside the singing tree, her own scars warmed, foreclosing vengeance. One slip: “gracefully alert” is repeated as label rather than enacted in every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s skepticism and “realistically imaginative” trait are embodied in her piezoelectric test and methodical unsealing, but interior contradiction is stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation of mysticism feels earned yet slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s interior contradiction—gentle illumination vs. ancestral fire—remains vivid, but the shift from mourning to hopeful intervention is more asserted than embodied; no single micro-choice on the page crystallizes the cost of her new path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his obsession with grief’s shape is embodied in the chisel, the ribbon, the circling steps—but the mentor’s guidance is too expository and the final shift to abstract carving feels slightly unearned, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt-driven micro-choices (carving, pressing the handle to the bob) are embodied and escalate under pressure; the final integration of confessions into the clock’s rhythm earns a credible renunciation of secrecy with visible cost—the inscriptions fade, their essence absorbed—yet the interior contradiction between haste and diligence is more summarized than dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s blitheness is embodied in humming and gentle pruning, but the interior contradiction—cheerfulness against spectral regret—never fully collides in a micro-choice; the final act of placing the case is tender yet feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with. Motivation to “discover the shape of intentions” is clear, but the cost is more spectral than personal, softening the earned edge needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the cold bit into her bones, yet her mind raced”), but the story withholds any decisive micro-choice under pressure; the final beat is suspended, not acted. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the absence of a visible cost at the ending caps the arc short of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, hushed vow—but the “teach dust to tell stories” motive is asserted more than dramatized until the final dust tableau. The moment he rests his hands carries earned cost, yet earlier beats lack micro-choices that complicate his stance. Still, the contradiction between meticulous copyist and outlaw broadcaster is embodied in the act of cloaking lyrics, giving him specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Intriguing, tactile interiority: Elias’s embodied need to capture the woman’s sorrow is legible.  Yet the arc leans toward summary rather than dramatized contradictory impulses—the final renunciation is asserted rather than fought for on the page, keeping the emotional cost visible but less earned. Backstory is tethered to present action (“donned the mask”) and tilts a micro-choice, satisfying BRR. The mask as surrogate mother-cup is specific, yet its scars are more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s drive to preserve “ancient methods” is clear and embodied in the tactile search, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final clutch of the cog crystallizes a credible renunciation of both surface myths, paying the cost of ongoing exile.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motive is dramatized early, but the interior contradictions are voiced rather than embodied; the climactic elder’s weep feels narrated, not earned, undercutting cost perception.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s sensory-memory vocation and grief-driven motivation are palpable, but interiority flirts with abstract wisdom-speak ("flavors of their last meal now blooming") more than felt paradox. Micro-choice to bite the fruit lands with cost, though earlier resolve is slightly over-told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and Thorne’s candor are sketched with vivid interiority and embodied stakes; the moment Thorne hands over the matchbox crystallizes both their motives under pressure. Yet the drone-hive collapse is reported rather than dramatized, muting the cost Elara must personally bear.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quiet compulsion is embodied through tactile noticing and micro-choices (picking up the shard, entering the unlocked cottage). The interior contradiction—yearning to preserve wonder while fearing its erasure—drives the final ritual. The earned cost is the shared secret he now carries, a hushed burden that forecloses naïveté. One slip: “inadvertently profound” is asserted rather than dramatized in the moment of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses around certainty vs. forgiveness play out in real time. The telepathic statue Liriel acts as external pressure, forcing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of rigid grudge carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “tears mixed with seawater” edges toward label.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grim optimism is embodied in every beat—his dice rolls, notebook scribbles, and final step through the door all spring from the same contradictory impulse. The chipped die as emblem of imperfection is a deft, character-specific anchor. Interiority stays mathematically precise yet emotionally legible. Only the “missed opportunity” regret is slightly abstract, keeping it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet, methodical hope is embodied in concrete choices—collecting scripts, distilling moonlight, painting symbols—but interior contradiction remains muted; the final act of rolling the scroll is earned yet feels more symbolic than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses—preservation vs. survival—surface in trembling hands and rosewater dread. The emerald lens and bread custom are extensions of her identity, not props. The final communal feast earns a credible renunciation of isolation, paid in shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-driven compulsion is embodied in tactile micro-choices—trembling fingers, counter-clockwise turns—yet the interior contradiction between hope and dread stays vivid. The final renunciation (“if this victory was merely another illusion”) lands with earned cost, though the family backstory is slightly over-summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s fear-of-abandonment motive is embodied in the defibrillator scar and the childhood confession; the paradox-driven unbosoming shows contradictory impulses in scene. The final vanquishing of fear is earned by prior causality, but the advisor remains a cipher whose stakes never crystallize, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prophet’s interiority is vivid—eyes “like polished sea glass,” kelp-tangled beard—but motivation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) is stated more than embodied; the final choice to compose rather than flee is earned yet cost is abstract. No contradictory impulses shown mid-scene; emotional arc is steady rather than layered. Single POV holds; no second character on page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “quiet determination” and “inner fire” are embodied in tactile micro-choices (aligning etching, trembling chisel). The contradiction between reverence for sacred shells and the need to crack one is dramatized in-scene, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses safety. Flawed reverence drives the irreversible act, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “heart ached” while his “mind methodically planned”—but the emotional contradiction never collides in a single beat; the final choice to seal the letter and leave is rational yet the cost is only asserted, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in the chill seeping through his coat and the steadiness of his hand while writing; the contradictory pull between duty and dream-chasing is dramatized when he kneels to hide the locket and note, sealing his own loss into the stone. The final endurance—accepting the drawbridge’s rise—carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lucid and consistent; the shift from indexer to guardian lands cleanly. Yet the cost of this identity reconfiguration is asserted more than embodied—no visceral forfeiture accompanies the discovery. The antique stamp functions as inherited talisman but never threatens or limits her; it is all affordance, no friction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in the detached shadow and the lantern craft; his micro-choice to polish the gem with dream-essence is specific and costly. Interiority stays concrete (“tears streamed… glowing faintly”) and the final release of cranes earns a fragile peace. The flaw—clinging to luminous memory—drives the ritual and its price. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amir’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in trembling fingers and whispered equations; the contradictory pull between vengeance and renewal is dramatized in the final reach toward the homeland pool. Interiority is specific, but the epiphany “to draw from it not vengeance, but renewal” arrives as a tidy label rather than earned contradiction, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s yearning for home is vivid, but her interiority leans on stock phrases (“perpetual surprise” repeated) and the pilgrim’s pressure is too gentle to force a visible cost. The final beat—her decision to pilot home—reads as inevitable rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s guilt operates in contradicticted micro-choices—the deliberate hand-tremble over the watch hand versus the calm outer silence on the terrace—anchoring the entire motivation arc. The switch from forged ancestry to confronting actual heritage feels earned because earlier seeds (“buried grandfather lies”) repay in the driftwood discovery. A hairline slip: summary of manufactured memories over dramatized implants before her final decline stops it short of true collision.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied; the brass pull anchors his guilt and resolve in tactile beats. His micro-choice to use the relic as key to both prisoners’ bonds crystallizes the arc. The apology/forgiveness limbo supplies credible internal cost. Minor: Kara and Ronan remain functional silhouettes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses (wanderlust vs. need for home) are embodied in the moment he pockets the compass and chooses the poles; the final renunciation carries visible cost (“weight of his broken past lifting”). Interiority is specific, but the partner’s absence keeps relational stakes off-page, limiting crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alex’s interior contradiction—cynical con-artist reflex versus nascent empathy—plays out in embodied micro-choices (tunnel vs. blank life, right vs. left fork). The memory-wipe premise risks “diagnostic label-speak,” but the baseball’s tactile presence and the final toss into glowing water earn a felt cost. Motivation tightens from hollow curiosity to self-redemption without tidy epiphany. One hairline slip: “jaded wonder” is asserted more than dramatized mid-journey.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s grief, desperation, and fear of losing identity are sharply embodied; her progression from mourning sibling to reluctant hybrid offers tangible emotional beats with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her throat tightening on the glade’s “choking beauty,” the saucer’s crack mirrored in her own fracture. The contradiction between seeking lost time while abandoning her newborn is dramatized, not summarized. The final vow to restart the hand-tracing custom with Mira is earned by the prior beat of dipping her hands in the pool and feeling “the weight of years lift.” Minor slip: the phrase “willingly perplexed” is asserted rather than enacted in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s pacifism is embodied in her refusal to strike and her choice to stitch, but the interior contradiction between pacifism and suppressed rage is told more than dramatized; the final weightless joy feels earned yet slightly abstract because the rage never visibly threatens her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet generosity and interior contradiction (destitute yet giving) are embodied in the act of carrying the jars; the final renunciation of his last treasure carries visible cost. Mira functions only as a catalyst, so relationship crucible is minimal. Interiority is specific but occasionally drifts toward gentle abstraction (“texture of transformation”).

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara manifests a single, clear stake—liberation through subtle sabotage—her vigilance and inventive tactics consistently impact beats; a second character only provides superficial verification, relationship depth isn’t attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority pulses vividly—"precognitively cursed...visions of betrayal or loss" vs "quiet promise to her vanished mother"—and the final renunciation ("she stood still") costs her prized elusiveness. Traits shape tangible choices: avoiding places, resisting star-dust temptation, then accepting rootedness. Only minor distance: the eel-herding skill is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between enforced silence and inner tempest is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (handling the envelope, resetting the timer). Motivation—mapping scars to rarefy rage into poetry—drives every beat. The final sealing of the new envelope crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost: further exile. One hairline slip: “ghost in his own language” flirts with label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—philosophical detachment wedded to a kinetic life—plays vividly in the duel, yet his emotional depth stays polished rather than raw; the mechanical arm feels integrated more as stylish prop than lived burden.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s molting trait is embodied in the itch and the shift to “fierce gardener of anarchy,” but the interior contradiction between wanderer and rebel is asserted more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost (Jax’s death, the tin’s legacy) and the micro-choice to scatter seeds anchors the new persona.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s longing is embodied in tactile piano play and the pocketed clock; his strategic creativity shows in decoding compasses and timing the splice. Yet the interior contradiction—yearning vs. acceptance—never sharpens under pressure; the filmic reunion feels gifted rather than wrested. Lila’s flickering presence is more apparition than crucible, so the relational change is asserted, not dramatized. The final smile registers triumph but the cost to Elias remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—empirical tool in one hand, whimsical faith in the other—is vivid and embodied throughout. The dream-choice to vocalize the fragments costs her the comfortable certainty she craves, forging a credible, visible price. Brief dips toward summary ("to protect... cultural memory") slightly dilute embodiment, but the final sprout and thunder anchor earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s slow, deliberate interiority and embodied emotion (cerulean regret, breath-matched pruning) are vivid; the final renunciation of drowning sorrow carries visible cost. Yet the severance with the beloved is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the contradiction that should power the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in her clinical detachment clashing with embodied grief over orchids; micro-choices like brushing dust then accepting decay reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in "stripped the needless theatrics from her grief." No diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority shows embodied contradiction (shattered yet adaptive) but "adaptive ancestors" label weakens struggle; climax insight lacks concrete cost—tears swell without tradeoff for the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels with embodied contradiction ("lips pursed, eyes alight") but "heat-mapping emotions" summary risks diagnostic label-speak; survival grief and wonder layer authentically during fork activation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’ "inadvertent stubbornness" manifests concretely in high-stakes void compression against resisting spirits, with embodied exhaustion ("robes heavy with water") driving choices. Motivation ("give rest a permanent address") intensifies organically through tactile interactions with the lens, avoiding stock phrasing. Minor deduction: occupational details as undertaker slightly underleveraged in tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied (e.g., bell "cool against his palm"), but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal moments; youth unrest is noted but never tests his resolve internally, preventing true 9.0-level interior conflict despite strong specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "healing through revealing" feels diagnostic rather than embodied under pressure. Tears mirroring Kwan Yin’s compassion provides strong embodied cost at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied motivation ("texture of time") and earned endurance with cost ("fading echoes"), but lacks contradictory impulses during the trap—Elias reacts without internal struggle between obsession and self-preservation. "Quaking reverie" repeats without deepening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation ("plant resilience in dry soil") is embodied through Elias's precise key-decoding under duress, but "motivation burned steady" edges toward abstraction without sufficient physical counterweight in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias seeking pain to heal ("to find the sound of trust breaking") with embodied cost ("tears welled"), but the partner's betrayal remains summarized reflection rather than active micro-choices under pressure during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interior contradiction (thief vs destiny-seeker) surfaces late; "life beyond thievery" epiphany lacks prior struggle with artistic yearning, making the earned endurance feel abrupt despite strong embodied doubt during the portrait reinterpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines via embodied choices: bookmark handling shifts from regret to talisman, but "iced-over heart" metaphor edges toward label-speak despite strong micro-choices under water-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority excels with embodied phobias ("bones shake," "agoraphobia clawed"), but Mara's motivation lacks depth, and the "vulnerability is power" theme edges toward tell in closure despite strong causal integration of flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("map endless night") drives action yet no visible tradeoffs or flaws complicate choices, weakening causality for closure. Mild obsession remains label-bound without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motivation ("find where thoughts come from") drives concrete actions like retrieving/playing the violin, with "remarkably composed" trait showing meaningful tradeoffs (no erratic beeps during epiphany). Lacks sufficient contradictory impulses in scene—Eko’s robotic nature versus emergent sentience remains intellectual rather than viscerally embodied during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction in Elias' mistrust versus yearning for connection powers the climax, but "frozen isolation" phrasing leans toward therapy-speak abstraction in peak beat, slightly diluting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses shine in moon-polishing ritual ("feigned surrender—with a private ritual"), avoiding label-speak. Micro-choices like selecting specific marbles reveal values under pressure, though Thorne lacks sufficient on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation (prove sideways time) is clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; Jax functions as plot device without depth. Closure choice (reversing lever) lacks character-specific tradeoffs, relying on plot convenience over earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied motivation (itching fingers, weight of history) but "lately inspired" remains abstract; ghost interaction lacks relational pressure. Final transformation feels earned though contradictory impulses during climax are underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion in smudging action reveals hierarchy of values, but tears resolve too neatly; "bitter herb" metaphor edges toward stock phrasing without sufficient character-specific distortion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction ("skepticism cracked") and embodied emotion ("eyelids heavy," "adrenaline surge") are strong, but the final realization about his father lacks micro-choice evidence beyond turning the wheel; closure feels slightly over-articulated for peak crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation ("witness without judgment") remains abstract and untested under pressure; no contradictory impulses or flawed choices emerge despite high-stakes observation. Keeper's actions follow ritual without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values, reducing interiority to thematic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority shines via micro-choices (adapting melodies to Finn's silence), but Elara's emotional calibration lacks irrationality under stress; flawless therapeutic precision feels unrealized in crisis moments.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction in Elias's "sensitively perceptive" nature versus scholarly desperation shows in tactile diary handling, but flaws lack visible struggle beyond mild tremors; micro-choices remain observational rather than high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior contradiction ("accidentally prophetic touch") and embodied motivation shine, but secondary characters lack micro-choices under pressure; the mayor's confession occurs off-page without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction ("resolve burned quietly") and embodied micro-choices (abrupt silence pause) powerfully reveal character under pressure, though "motivation burned quietly" edges toward abstraction without sufficient physicality in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction (homesick for time yet conducting forward) drives micro-choices like tracing shell ridges; embodied exhaustion ("limbs heavy, breaths shallow") earns the final stance shift without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction shines in timeline choices (love vs power, solitude vs connection), embodied through physical light/dark shifts; final forgiveness earned by layered failures without therapy-speak; "periodically eternal" flaw drives every attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority anchored in vibration over sound avoids therapy-speak; Elias’s micro-choice to layer songs shows hierarchy of values. Mira’s silent tears embody contradiction (grief/release), but minimal internal conflict in peak beats costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction between curiosity and integrity preservation is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., slow approach to pigeon), but the conflict resolves too neatly without sustained simultaneous tension during peak pressure of message interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines when Elias balances curiosity against fear while uncorking the vial, but the "darker recollections" summary of his mother's illness leans toward told reflection rather than embodied choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines in "ethically playful" trait (limericks vs. moral fraying), but prison rope memory lacks a second concrete tradeoff beyond patterning. Micro-choice with rope coiling earns closure, though limerick example feels slightly underdeveloped for full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority crystallizes through acoustic perception: "bowl's hum grew, vibrating against his palms" shows embodied contradiction between releasing and preserving the echo. Final vow to "revel in eternal becoming" earns renunciation with visible cost in the lingering hush.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority avoids therapy-speak ("cataloging anomalies like a ledger of souls"); embodied contradiction in "affectionate detachment" toward past self. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses at climax—subsumption feels too smooth for high-band 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias' cargo-broker pragmatism versus impulse to return the envelope, but "cautious exuberance" labels verge on stock phrasing; embodied cost in the locket reveal elevates micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interior contradiction absent; "boldly sympathetic" drives action but lacks embodied tension under pressure. "Luminescent ache" label replaces specific physicality during key searches.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction evident in her dual focus on illustration and mythic quest; embodied emotion in clutching pendant during high-stakes dive. Final choice to free the bird earns endurance through prior causality (sculpting time fragments), though "true quest burned deeper" risks slight telling.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (doubt vs hope) act simultaneously in ritual; final acceptance of ambiguous hope is earned through tactile micro-choices with visible emotional cost ("quiet hope blooming"). No therapy-speak despite high-stakes grief.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction in seclusion vs need to help is embodied through pipe chase actions, but wartime reflection exceeds BRR 20% limit without clear present micro-choice tilt; "sense memory" label slightly clinical for peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction evident in panic vs curiosity during transformation, but "reluctant and unbidden" slightly over-articulates emotion; micro-choices like pocketing the leaf reveal hierarchy of values without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interior contradiction under trauma lacks simultaneous tension; "haggard awe" label repeats without embodied conflict. Strength: micro-choice of brooch exchange reveals hierarchy of values (art vs. connection) with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction evident in "rigid predictions" versus fluid awareness, but transformation lacks embodied struggle; "gasped" and "realized" lean toward label-heavy emotion in pivotal inhabitation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's "reactively visionary" trait avoids label-speak through embodied actions like clutching the valve as visions surge; her motivation to compile fragments into meaning drives all choices without over-tidiness, though contradictory impulses in the final closure beat lack sufficient layering.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in "mapping escapes instead of facing pain" confession, but "bad habits shatter" resolution feels unearned—cost lacks visceral embodiment despite strong micro-choices early on.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction shines (skepticism vs kindness driving action) but "guilt for not believing in miracles sooner" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, violating rubric's -0.4 to -0.6 prohibition for abstract emotional labeling during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clear motivation (boredom seeking "after-goodbye") but interiority remains abstract; "boredom tempered by knowledge" reads as diagnostic label-speak at closure, undermining embodied contradiction. No contradictory impulses manifest in scene choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in ink-testing scene where rigid ethics dissolve into clarity, but "burning need" phrasing edges toward abstraction. Final choice earned through prior causality with visible transformation cost as Alex closes the casket.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction evident in "touch without grasping" restraint, but closure choice lacks visible struggle; micro-choices under pressure (charting staccato hum) earn motivation yet final resolve feels untested by flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority leans abstract ("veils of what-ifs") but gains specificity through tactile memory textures; final renunciation of void for strength is earned though contradictory impulses lack simultaneous scene manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority excels with "gloomy cheerfulness" embodiment, but epiphany lacks earned struggle; the "resilient joy" realization feels unmoored from prior micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in Lanara's dual allegiance—bohemian roots vs reformer alliances—but "hopeful desperation" edges toward label-speak despite embodied actions like clutching the stone chip. Final choice earned through prior encoding work, though micro-choices lack deeper tactical tradeoffs under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "dawnlit melancholy" stated as label rather than embodied through specific physical tradeoffs. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond generic sorrow, weakening Earned Stasis. Diagnostic label-speak in climax triggers -0.6 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s blindness-as-strength, but Mira’s urgency lacks embodied tension beyond dialogue; "synthetic hum irregular and pleading" risks diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in "subtly confident" demeanor masking "quiet anxiety" and dry wit deflecting peril, but the internal conflict lacks layered irrationality beyond confidence/anxiety duality during high-stakes decision to step onto ice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation ("restore shared balance") clear and embodied through ritual, but interior contradiction absent; patience shown via actions yet no cost to flaw during pressure. Final endurance lacks visible trade-off despite strong micro-choices in guiding newcomers.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in panic versus calm; micro-choices like forced stillness and vial uncorking reveal hierarchy of values. Slight over-tidiness in memory-triggered calm reduces irrationality, but embodied emotion ("gloved fingers trembled") and flaw-driven struggle with instinct override earn high marks.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority leans thematic ("rebuild truth from scraps") rather than embodied conflict; contradictory impulses absent despite high stakes. Diagnostic label "hush" replaces concrete sensory struggle during pivotal confession.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s embodied contradiction (yearning for the veil’s embrace while tending the orchard) and micro-choices (pruning, channeling resonance) align with debt repayment. Flaws lack active struggle—his passivity avoids testing blind spots, missing the "inevitable mistakes" requirement for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied motivation ("carve path from ruin to reverence") drives choices, but internal contradiction lacks depth; "hauntingly optimistic" trait shown through actions yet remains somewhat archetypal without deeper flaw exploration.

No contradictory impulses act simultaneously during pivotal moments like the orb’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s restlessness and Marek’s hidden tenderness manifest through embodied micro-choices (scrimshaw passed twice, jaw traced) under pressure, avoiding therapy-speak. Final transformation earned by scrimshaw-triggered lineage memories, though Marek’s depth slightly thin for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Marcus' trembling hands while confessing data manipulation, yet Elara's "steadily curious" trait borders on label repetition without deeper friction against her inherited duty.

    Contradictory impulses act vividly (rigid doctrines fraying vs. embracing wind's language); final renunciation of the gear's need is earned through visceral unraveling with clear cost (tears, gear's silence). Slight tell in "clarified insights" slightly undercuts embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines via Elias's trembling hands and halting accordion melody, embodying "fractured spirit" without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)

    Lira's pacifism manifests concretely through "stitching not striking" during shadow confrontations, with embodied contradictions (suppressed rage vs. mending actions). Final integration earns her transformation, though emotional progression feels slightly tidy in the three-photo sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction (generosity vs destitution) and embodied emotion during rockslide rescue stand out, but "texture of transformation" phrasing veers into diagnostic label-speak violating POV lexicon under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (guardian vs. revolutionary) drive micro-choices like concealing the quill holder, but flawless competence lacks meaningful flaws; no blind spots compound choices despite strong interiority in blackout pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction (elusiveness vs promise) drives the climax, but "premonitions" lack embodied specificity during the rock placement; curse manifests as vague "flickering visions" without physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "furiously tranquil" duality, but emotional progression lacks layering—rage-to-wonder shift feels narratively convenient without sufficient embodied struggle in the climactic rewriting scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines in "dignified chaos" vs inner turmoil, but contact lacks depth; micro-choices like tracing sundial edges reveal values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in molting trait driving action (shedding "weary wanderer" for rebellion), but "fueled by motivation" slightly over-articulates internal state. Jax relationship crystallizes values with felt cost ("carrying only the coffee tin... hidden compartment for contraband hope").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction shines in "steely longing" and strategic despair-to-symphony pivot; micro-choices like decoding compasses reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Broken clock's embodied weight and mending provide visible cost without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction ("luminous doubt") is concrete but emotional embodiment stays abstract; "dissolving like mist" risks cliché. Micro-choices under pressure (interpreting dreams while doubting) align with motivation yet lack visceral physicality during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in "words diffusing like vapor" apology—embodied regret avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice of speaking aloud earns closure, but "cerulean regret" label risks abstraction without sufficient physicality in peak beat.
